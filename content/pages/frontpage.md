   <h3><em>Giving Attribution Where It's Due</em></h3>
   
This is a blog for my forays into "literary sleuthing," where I try to track down author attributions and original publication sources
for unattributed (usually public domain) works.

Sometimes I investigate quotes, and other literary mysteries, too.

<h3>My Current Cases</h3>

#### [The Occult Detectives of Victor Rousseau](/pages/victor-rousseau/)

Victor Rousseau produced three occult detective series in the early decades of the twentieth century, and wrote a few standalone tales, too.
I'm collecting links and/or making transcriptions of all the stories from these series that I can find.

#### [Selected Stories of Austin Philips](/pages/austin-philips/)

I'm collecting as many of the Post Office detective and Post Office supernatural short stories of Austin Philips as I can find online. Possibly some non-post office crime stories, too.

For previous sleuthing projects, see the [My Cases](/pages/my-investigations/) page.
