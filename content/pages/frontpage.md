   <h3><em>Giving Attribution Where It's Due</em></h3>
   
This is a blog for my forays into "literary sleuthing," where I try to track down author attributions and original publication sources
for unattributed (usually public domain) works.

Sometimes I investigate quotes, and other literary mysteries, too.

<h3>My Current Cases</h3>

#### [Selected Stories from *Tales of an Antiquary* (1828)](/pages/tales-of-an-antiquary/)

This rather unreadable 1828 fictional "memoir" by antiquarian Richard Thomson has some interesting stories buried within it. 
I'm reviving some of these highlights and featuring them here.


#### [Selected Stories of Austin Philips](/pages/austin-philips/)

I'm collecting as many of the Post Office detective and Post Office supernatural short stories of Austin Philips as I can find online. Possibly some non-post office crime stories, too.


#### [Miscellany and Digressions](/pages/miscellany-and-digressions/)

These are literary investigations that pop up while I’m in the middle of another project (often, another investigation). I get curious about things, and I can’t help but dig. Since the results don’t always fit neatly into the other “active case” categories on the site, I keep them here.

For previous sleuthing projects, see the [My Cases](/pages/my-investigations/) page.
