<h2>Selected Stories from <em>Tales of An Antiquary</em> (1828)</h2>

*Tales of an Antiquary: chiefly illustrative of the manners, traditions, and remarkable localities of ancient London* is a three-volume collection of stories, with a frame, by antiquarian [Richard Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thomson_(antiquarian)).
Thomson took several pieces that he'd originally published in a defunct periodical, revised and extended them, and wove them into the rambling memoirs of the fictional antiquarian, Sylvanus Beauclerk.

While many of the stories are quite interesting, the work as a whole is tedious and verbose---an opinion shared by contemporary reviewers:

> We think the author has been led away by a false idea of conforming to the taste of the times, of writing a popular work, yet so full of his antiquarian lore that the mere story-teller sinks under the weight.<br>--- Review in *The Literary Gazette, and Journal of the Belles Lettres* January 26, 1828

I've skimmed through the volumes, so you don't have to, and found some of the highlights. If you are curious, however, you can find scans of all three volumes at [HathiTrust](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000122613).

## Volume 1

Volume 1 covers the period from 1100-1560. Many of the stories are pastiches of German Gothic, which was fashionable at the time.

[**The Severed Arm; or The Wehr-wolf of Limousin**](https://freeread.com.au/@RGLibrary/Unknown/Anon/TheSeveredArm.html) (Link to *Roy Glashan's Library*): According to Roy Glashan, this may be the first Gothic werewolf story ever published. It was reprinted several times in the nineteenth century, and once in abridged form by Peter Haining. Glanshan's version is the complete version, I believe from *Tales of an Antiquary*.

[**The Legend of the Broken Turret**](/tales-of-an-antiquary/legend-of-the-broken-turret/): The history of St. Agnes of the Broken Tower, an old ruined church in Nuremberg. It's a tale of dealings with the devil, and tragic romance.

[**The Paradise of Bears**](/tales-of-an-antiquary/paradise-of-bears/): A sweet little fairy tale about a gentle orphan who learns the secret of where bears really go when they "hibernate."
