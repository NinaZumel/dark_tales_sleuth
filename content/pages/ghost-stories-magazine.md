<h2>Selected Stories from <em>Ghost Stories</em> Magazine</h2>

I will need filler text here.

The tales in *Ghost Stories* were all presented as true, first-person narratives, often one told by the narrator to a ghostwriter (so to speak) who wrote the story down. Hence, the author credits often read something like "by *protagonist*, as related to *author*." In the listings below, I only list the actual author, with references to more information about them, when that is available. 

Many of the author names are pseudonyms; when applicable, I've also mentioned the author's possible real name, as listed in James R. Seiger's 1973 [index of the magazine](https://archive.org/details/Ghost_Stories_Stories_of_Ghosts_1973_OPAR_pamphlet_on_Ghost_Stories_pulp/page/n3/mode/2up).
