<h2>Evening Tales for the Winter, Volume Three</h2>

Volume Three was a later addition to what had originally been _Tales of Terror_ (1833); the stories here are mostly fairly prosaic and non-supernatural.

Links below will lead to cleaner copies of the stories, usually (but not always) the original source; the scans from _Evening Tales_ are quite dirty.

Unless otherwise indicated, authorship attributions are from ISFDB, and original source information is my research.
