<h2>Selected Stories of Austin Philips (1875-1947)</h2>

Austin Philips was a British author and the son of a postmaster, who not only became a postmaster himself, but also served in an investigative branch of the Post Office which "co-operated with the British Intelligence Services in checking suspect mail."[Ashley, 2018] These experiences made their way into much of his writing, which included Post Office crime novels, Post Office-related short stories and even [Post Office poems](https://www.poetryexplorer.net/poem.php?id=10115327). He wrote a variety of other short fiction, novels, plays, and poetry as well.

This selection will focus on Philips' Post Office detective stories, ghost stories, and articles, as well as collecting some non-Post Office crime tales.
