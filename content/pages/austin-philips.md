<h2>Selected Stories of Austin Philips (1875-1947)</h2>

Austin Philips was a British author and the son of a postmaster, who not became a postmaster himself, but also "served in the Post Office's investigation branch which co-operated with the British Intelligence Services in checking suspect mail."[Ashley, 1918] These experiences made their way into much of his writing, which included Post Office crime novels, Post Office-related short stories and even [Post Office poems](https://www.poetryexplorer.net/poem.php?id=10115327). He wrote a variety of other short fiction, novels, plays, and poetry as well.

This selection will concentrate on Philips' Post Office detective stories, and articles, as well as his supernatural tales.
