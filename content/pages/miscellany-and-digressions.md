# Miscellany and Digressions

![Bridges 06](http://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/bridges-06.jpg "bridges-06.jpg")

These are literary investigations that pop up while I'm in the middle of another project (often, another investigation). I get curious about things, and I can't help but dig. Since the results don't always fit neatly into the other categories on the site, I keep them here.

[**Attributions for _The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century_ :**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/01/25/side-excursion-the-struggling-astrologer-issue-one/) An 1825 compendium of occultish pieces lifted without attribution from various literary and astrological journals. So of course, I had to track those attributions down. Includes an interesting piece purporting to be from the diaries of John Dee. I couldn't prove that it was, but I couldn't prove that it wasn't either.

[**The Legend of Old Spital Inn:**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/02/23/the-legend-of-old-spital-inn/) Discusses an earlier version of the Spital Inn legend that Vincent Price reads on the 1974 album _A Graveyard of Ghost Tales_. I also provide an English translation for a 17th century account of an "Aztec hand of glory."

[**The Cavern of Steenfoll:**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/06/11/the-cavern-of-steenfoll/) This is a retelling of R. P. Gillies' "The Nikkur Holl" by German Romantic writer Wilhelm Hauff. Read both and decide which you like better!

[**Spukenswald:**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/06/28/spukenswald/) A delightfully gory German gothic pastiche by Lambert A. Wilmer, friend and colleague of Edgar Allan Poe.

[**Hunting the Ghost of Lille:**](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2022/09/06/hunting-the-ghost-of-lille/) Two versions of a "true" haunted house story from Lille, France.
