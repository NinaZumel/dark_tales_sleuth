# Vincent Price and Caedmon Records

Caedmon Records, founded in 1952, was the first company to sell spoken word recordings to the public; the predecessors of the audiobook, you might say. In the 1970s, Vincent Price released several recordings for Caedmon, readings of ghost tales and fantasies.

You can find several of these recordings on YouTube. Price's smooth and expressive voice is always a pleasure to listen to, and the stories are engaging, more like ghostly folktales or urban legends than horror stories, but that suits me just fine.

I was surprised, however, that the first two LPs that I listened to give no credits for the readings. Nor could I find any information on literary sources anywhere online. So I decided to do a little digging on my own.

I haven't read most of the books or texts that I mention in these posts, so I can't one hundred percent guarantee my attributions. However, Jenny Ashford on the Facebook group _Alone with the Horrors: Horror Fiction_ also did some digging (thank you, Jenny!), and her research seems consistent with mine. So, for now, here are my best educated guesses on the literary sources for _A Graveyard of Ghost Tales_ and _Tales of Witches, Ghosts, and Goblins_.

- [A Graveyard of Ghost Tales (1974)](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/a-graveyard-of-ghost-tales-1974/)
