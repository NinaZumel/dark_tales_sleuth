<h2>The Occult Detectives of Victor Rousseau</h2>

Victor Rousseau Emanuel (1879-1960) was a British-born journalist, novelist and pulp fiction writer who lived at various times in Britain, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. He wrote fiction in a variety of genres, under several pen names, primarily, "Victor Rousseau". 
Here, I'm collecting his stories of occult detection, in particular from his three series:

* Ivan Brodsky, Surgeon of Souls
* Phileas Immanuel, Tracer of Egos
* Dr. Martinus, Occultist.

While collections of the Ivan Brodsky and Phileas Immanuel series exist, they are out of print, and fairly hard to find legitimately. 
So I'm collecting as many of the stories as I can find at online archives, and either linking to the archival sources or transcribing them here. 
The Dr. Martinus series has never been collected. I will transcribe the stories that I can find, and list publication information for the remaining tales.

## Dr. Ivan Brodsky, Surgeon of Souls

Dr. Ivan Brodsky is a Polish immigrant living in the United States, and a Professor of Nervous Diseases. 
He treats his patients using Spiritualistic principles. His cases are chronicled by an unnamed medical colleague who acts as Brodsky's personal secretary. 

This is one of the earliest "occult detective," or "psychic detective" series. 
Its first known appearance was in the *Stevens Point Journal*, a Wisconsin newspaper, from 1910-1911, bylined H.M. Egbert. 
Ten of the original stories, plus an additional introductory story, ran in *Weird Tales* from 1926-1927.

## Dr. Martinus, Occultist

Dr. Martinus is a Dutch-born investigator of psychic phenomena, as well as a physician. He conducts much of his research empirically, often through the use of mediums and seances. Martinus' cases are chronicled by his research assistant, a former newspaper reporter named Branscombe.

Five Dr. Martinus stories and a six-part novella appeared in *Ghost Stories Magazine* between October 1826 and May 1928. 
The tales in *Ghost Stories* were all presented as true, first-person narratives, with the narrator credited as the author, "as told to" the actual writer., 

[Read my discussion of *Dr Martinus* here.](/blog/2025-08-24-dr-martinus-occultist/)

### The Stories 

Below I've listed all the Dr. Martinus stories, with publication information as listed in James R. Seiger's 1973 [index of the magazine](https://archive.org/details/Ghost_Stories_Stories_of_Ghosts_1973_OPAR_pamphlet_on_Ghost_Stories_pulp/page/n3/mode/2up).
I will transcribe and post those (few) stories that I can find.

In keeping with the conceit of the magazine, I'll give each story as "by Arthur/Eugene Branscombe, as told to Victor Rousseau."

[**Child or Demon—Which?**](/victor-rousseau/child-or-demon-which/) - *Ghost Stories*, October 1926
<br><span class="inline-note">Branscombe's first name is given here as Eugene. He becomes Arthur in the next story.</span>

**Ghost of the Red Cavalier** - *Ghost Stories*, March 1927

**Fire Water—and What** - *Ghost Stories*, June 1927
