<h2>The Occult Detectives of Victor Rousseau (1879 - 1960)</h2>

Born Victor Rousseau Emanuel

While print collections of the Ivan Brodsky and Phileas Immanuel series exist, they are out of print, and fairly hard to find legitimately. So I've collected as many of the stories as I could find at online archives, and either linked to the archival sources or transcribed them here. The Dr. Martinus series has never been collected. I have transcribed the stories that I could find, and listed publication information for the remaining tales.

## Dr. Ivan Brodsky, Surgeon of Souls

This is one of the earliest "occult detective," or "psychic detective" series. Dr. Ivan Brodsky is a Polish immigrant to the U.S., and a Professor of Nervous Diseases. He treats his patients using Spiritualistic principles. His cases are chronicled by an unnamed medical colleague who acts as Brodsky's personal secretary. 

The earliest known appearance of this series was in *Stevens Point Journal*, a Wisconsin newspaper, from 1910-1911, as by H.M. Egbert. The stories are copyright 1909, Great Britain. Ten of the original stories, plus an additional introductory story, ran in *Weird Tales* from 1926-1927.

All twelve stories were collected by Spectre Library in 2006, with an introduction by Mike Ashley. This collection is now sold out, but there is [an audiobook](https://archive.org/details/ivanbrodsky_2405_librivox) of the stories available at the Internet Archive. There appears to be a [2009 ebook](https://pulpfictionbook.store/downloads/dr-ivan-brodsky-surgeon-of-souls-by-victor-rousseau/) with the eleven stories that ran in *Weird Tales*. In 2011, Spectre Library released [another book](http://www.darkfantasy.org/spectre/HisSecondSelf.html) with a previously unknown thirteenth Ivan Brodsky story, "The Cats That Looked at Cohen." I do not know when or where that tale originally appeared.

Here are links to the twelve known stories. The order here is as published in *Weird Tales*. "Homo Homunculus" is interpolated in, based on the order of the [Spectre Library collection](https://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?314459), which is different from the *Weird Tales* order.
