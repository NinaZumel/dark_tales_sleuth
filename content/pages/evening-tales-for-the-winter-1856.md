# Evening Tales for the Winter

_Evening Tales for the Winter_ is an 1856 anthology of supernatural and gothic tales, compiled by Henry St. Clair. The first two volumes were originally published as _Tales of Terror, or the Mysteries of Magic_ (1833). Its subtitle is "Wonderful & Supernatural Stories Translated from the Chinese, Turkish and German." Neither the translators nor the original authors/sources are credited.

Not all the pieces are actually translations, and none of them are from the Chinese or Turkish. Several are from German, two of them translated by [Thomas de Quincey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_De_Quincey).

And some are historically interesting, too. Early on in this project, I found [the first English translation of a story from _The Thousand and One Nights_](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/the-puzzle-of-judar/). Later, I discovered [the first English translation of (part of) an infamous German gothic novel](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/notes-on-the-astrologer-of-the-nineteenth-century/). Pretty cool!

The anthology is in three volumes, and I set up a separate Table of Contents plus attributions for each volume. Each Table of Contents links to a post about the individual stories, where I discuss my research and sometimes include a PDF transcription of the story.

- [Table of Contents and Attributions, Volume 3](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/evening-tales-for-the-winter-volume-three/)

You can find a (rather dirty) scan of _Evening Tales for the Winter_ [at the Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog). The original of that scanned volume came from the library of [Sarah Orne Jewett](https://spartacus-educational.com/DICjewett.htm), who like her contemporary Mary Wilkins Freeman wrote New England regional fiction, often with traces of the weird or supernatural.
