  <h3>Hi There!</h3>

    I'm Nina, and literary sleuthing is one of my hobbies. *Dark Tales Sleuth* is one of my many blogs. This is where I keep the results of my authorship attribution research, and other literary investigations that I indulge in.

    If you're curious, you can find out more about me at [*NinaZumel.com*](https://ninazumel.com/pages/personal/).

    I don't do regular social media, but you can follow [@MultoGhost](https://micro.blog/MultoGhost) at Micro.blog, or follow me here directly via RSS. I also point to my *Dark Tales Sleuth* posts from my primary blog, [*Multo(Ghost)*](https://multoghost.wordpress.com), which is a Wordpress blog, so you can follow me there, if you like.
    
    If you want to drop me a note, please feel free to send me an email, via the email icon at the footer of this blog.
