#### [Evening Tales for the Winter](/pages/evening-tales-for-the-winter-1856/)

Case Complete! _Evening Tales for the Winter_ is an 1856 anthology of gothic and supernatural tales, compiled by Henry St. Clair. Many of these  "Wonderful & Supernatural Stories," were translated from German sources. Neither the translators nor original authors/stories are credited, so I’ve tracked down author and translator attributions for the stories included.

#### [Vincent Price and Caedmon Records](/pages/vincent-price-and-caedmon-records/)

An early case, tracking down the sources of Vincent Price's readings on two spooky LPs he recorded for Caedmon Records in the 1970s.

#### [Quote Attributions](/pages/quote-attributions/)

In progress. My attempts to correctly attribute incorrectly or incompletely attributed quotes.

#### [Miscellany and Digressions](/pages/miscellany-and-digressions/)

These are literary investigations that pop up while I’m in the middle of another project (often, another investigation). I get curious about things, and I can’t help but dig. Since the results don’t always fit neatly into the other “active case” categories on the site, I keep them here.
