I'll finish up my posts on Volume One of _Evening Tales for the Winter_ with a brief discussion of the remaining three stories.

"[The Cavern of Death](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n124/mode/2up)" is a longer novella in the gothic style, set (of course) in the depths of the Black Forest. It starts out well enough, with a handsome young couple in love, an interfering father, intrigue, family skeletons, and the mysterious dark cavern of the title. I confess that I gave up about midway through. Full-blown gothic isn't one of my preferred genres, and this got a little too gothic for me.

Despite the story's German setting, I couldn't find any indication that the story itself is actually German. It first appeared in 1794, as a serial in the newspaper _The True Briton_, and seems to be inspired by other (English authored) popular Gothic novels of the time, such as _The Castle of Otranto_. It proved to be quite popular, going through several editions, as well as translations into other languages.

In 1802, the novel came out in abbreviated chapbook form as _The Black Forest; or, The Cavern of Horrors! A Gothic Romance_. Another abbreviated version appeared in 1830 as _The Black Forest; or The Cavern of Death, A Bohemian Romance_. I suppose that the version in _Evening Tales for the Winter_ is one of these shorter versions, though I haven't read any of them to compare.

While doing research for this tale, I was amused to discover [an 1800 German translation of the novel](https://books.google.com/books?id=MUpZAAAAcAAJ&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) by Friederike Caroline Schlege. If I've deciphered the title page correctly, her translation is from the French!

If you are interested in reading the original 1794 novel, it's been [reissued by Valancourt Books](https://www.valancourtbooks.com/the-cavern-of-death-1794.html), with an introduction by Allen Grove. Most of the information that I've given here is from Grove's introduction.

"[The Dervise Alfouran](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n168/mode/2up)" and "[Hassan Assar](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n176/mode/2up)" are both originally from the 1764 collection [_Tales of the Genii_](https://archive.org/stream/talesofgenii00morerich?ref=ol#page/n5/mode/2up) by "Sir Charles Morell, Formerly Ambassador for the British Settlements in India to the Great Mogul." They were supposedly translations of a Persian work by an imam named Horam.

In reality, the tales are an English-authored pastiche of _The Arabian Nights_, which first appeared in English over the period 1706-1708 as an anonymous translation of Antione Galland's French translation (1704-1717). Galland's translation is the first European appearance of the story cycle known as _One Thousand and One Nights_, or _The Arabian Nights_. The author of _Tales of the Genii_, James Ridley, briefly held a chaplaincy with the East India Company, though I can't tell whether he ever went to India (I think he didn't). At the time that he wrote _Tales of the Genii_, Ridley held a church living in Essex that had been handed down from his father. He died in 1765.

I'm sure that "The Dervise Alfouran" and "Hassan Assar" are fine stories, but I must admit that I skipped over them. Remember, when I started reading _Evening Tales for the Winter_ I was looking for ghost stories and potential material for my [Winter Tales](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/winter-tales/) series. These stories, as great as they may be, clearly weren't going to fit in that category, so I've skipped reading them, for now.
