I'm still working on the Austin Philips Post Office short stories project that I started last year. Today, 
I have another crime story from Philips' 1910 collection *Red Tape*.

In ["The Watching Gallery,"](/austin-philips/the-watching-gallery/) an ambitious young post office employee spends
Christmas Eve looking for a serial postal thief.

This story is another interesting behind-the-scenes tale, which makes good use of Philips' background investigating 
crimes for the UK Post Office. I hope you enjoy it.
