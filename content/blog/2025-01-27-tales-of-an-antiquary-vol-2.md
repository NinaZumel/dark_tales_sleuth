I've collected another three stories from [Volume 2](/pages/tales-of-an-antiquary/#volume-2) of *Tales of an Antiquary*, for your reading pleasure.

Volume Two relates several extended adventure tales set in and around the English Civil War and Commonwealth Period, a period marked by the fall
of the monarchy, and the rise of Oliver Cromwell and his Puritan followers. This period was also marked the often brutal
repression of other Christian denominations, in particular Anglicanism and Roman Catholicism, but apparently other sects as well.

So, naturally, these tales are told from the Puritan point of view. We've got a full load of witches and demons, ready to be vanquished
by brave defenders of the true (Puritan) faith. Do enjoy!
