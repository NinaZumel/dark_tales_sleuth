I've posted another Dr. Martinus story to [the project page](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-martinus-occultist).

In [**The Doll That Came to Life**](/victor-rousseau/doll-that-came-to-life/), Dr. Martinus must contend with both a malicious, doll-possessing poltergeist, and a fraudulent spiritualist
who keeps giving their mutual client the wrong advice. Will he prevail?

This is, unfortunately, the last Dr. Martinus story I could find, other than the first installment of "The House of the Living Dead." It seems cruel to post that with
giving you the rest of the story, so I won't. If you really want to read it,  I have the original publication info of all the published stories on the project page.
Maybe someday more issues of *Ghost Stories* magazine will come to light, and we will find more Martinus tales.

If Rousseau's pattern holds, he likely killed Dr. Martinus off at the end of this serial; but over the next few years, he wrote at least another two occult researcher stories. 
Both of them bear a strong resemblance to Dr. Martinus, at least in their setup and their *modus operandi*. I will share those with you as well, as time permits.

In the meantime, enjoy!
