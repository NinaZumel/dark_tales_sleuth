We're concluding the [*Occult Detectives of Victor Rousseau*](/pages/victor-rousseau/) with one last story, from *Strange Tales of Mystery and Terror*, September 1931.

In [**A Cry From Beyond**](/victor-rousseau/cry-from-beyond/), Dr. Claude Merrick investigates a case at the behest of a spirit: the late artist, Weathermore. The wife of Alfred French, another artist, keeps falling into strange, cataleptic sleep; their daughter is mysteriously wasting away. Could French's dead first wife be the culprit?

Taken on its own, this isn't a bad story at all. But if you've been reading a lot of Rousseau's occult investigator fiction, you'll find this tale fairly derivative.
The plot is a variation on the first Dr. Martinus story, ["Child or Demon--Which?"](/victor-rousseau/child-or-demon-which/). The discussion of "elementals" waiting to prey on the living harks back to the [Ivan Brodsky](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-ivan-brodsky-surgeon-of-souls) series. And like Brodsky, Merrick believes that most cases of insanity are really due to spiritual possession.


The basic character setup of an occult investigator with a servant *cum* medium as his assistant is just like [the previous story I shared](/victor-rousseau/blackest-magic-of-all/), featuring Dr. Rinaldi. There are details, like the poltergeist anecdote, that I recognized from previous stories. The only work this story doesn't remind me of is the Dr. Immanuel series.

But as I said, it's not bad, and it does have some of the horror story elements that Rousseau began introducing into his occult detection tales with the Dr. Martinus series.  I liked that Dr. Merrick got "hired" by a ghost to take on this case. I also liked the public telephone analogy of communicating with the other world:

>  Imagine a public call-box, with the receiver off the hook, and a mob, all at the same time, trying to transmit messages, while half asleep, to various friends; also imagine a group of urchins interrupting them to shout opprobrious epithets or to play pranks, and you begin to get some notion of the difficulties of posthumous communication. 


Dr. Merrick's servant/medium is his Chinese "houseboy" (ugh) Charlie Wing, which is cringey, but I've read worse. His Watson is his personal secretary, Benson. 

Overall, a satisfying way to wrap up this series. Do enjoy.
