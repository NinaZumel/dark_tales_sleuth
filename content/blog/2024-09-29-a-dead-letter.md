I've put up a new Austin Philips story: ["A Dead Letter"](/austin-philips/a-dead-letter/), from the January 1909 issue of the *Strand Magazine*.

This is a post office themed ghost story, set on Christmas Eve. It features both a moaning ghost, and a ghost envelope! And the
reader gets a little piece of British Post Office history, as well.

Enjoy.
