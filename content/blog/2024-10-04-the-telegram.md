The latest Austin Philips story is up: ["The Telegram"](/austin-philips/the-telegram/), from the July 1909 issue of the *Strand Magazine*.

Florence Earle is a naive young telegraph operator, who may just be making a big mistake. 

"The Telegram" is a crime story, though not a detective story. It is, however, a Post Office story, as in the UK the Post Office took
over all the telegraph services in 1870, from the private companies that had previously run them. It's a quiet little tale with a cute twist, where the suspense comes primarily from watching someone about to do something very foolish, with no one around to stop them.

Enjoy.
