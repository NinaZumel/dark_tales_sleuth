“The Tiger’s Cave” was a story from Volume Two of _Evening Tales for the Winter_, which I identified in [a previous post](/blog/2021-06-05-notes-on-the-tigers-cave/) as first appearing in _The Monthly Magazine_, March 1831. It’s a pulpy piece about the adventures of the narrator and his friends in the mountains of Quito, where they come upon the titular cave.

At the time, I surmised that it was probably a translation of a story from the Danish literary magazine _Laesefrugter_, edited by Adolph Frederik Elmquist. Since I don’t read Danish, I couldn’t research any further—in particular, I couldn’t find out what the original story was, when it was published, or who wrote it.

But recently, commenter Tara Challoner [let me know](/pages/comments/#tara-challoner-december-23-2023) that she had found an earlier English appearance of this story—May 30, 1829—that itself seemed to be from the _Edinburgh Literary Journal_. This earlier appearance indicated that the original story was German. Ah!

Following Tara’s lead, I tracked down the version she found to the [_Edinburgh Literary Journal_](https://archive.org/details/sim_edinburgh-literary-journal-or-weekly-register_1829-03-21_19/page/260/mode/2up?view=theater) No. 19, Saturday, March 21, 1829, p 260, where it appears with the note:

> Translated from the Danish of Elmquist and the German of Döring, by one of the Authors of the “Odd Volume.” “Tales and Legends,” &c.

This puts the Danish (and, of course, the German) version earlier than March 1829.

Now, there’s a lot to unpack from this new discovery. The first item is that the _Edinburgh Literary Journal_ version (henceforth, the “ELJ version”) **_is a different translation_**. Not only is the wording of the ELJ version slightly different from the _Monthly Magazine_ (henceforth, “MM”) version, it also omits the introductory section: the equivalent of the first six paragraphs of the MM version.

But both versions have the same title, which makes it likely that this is also the title of at least the Danish version (a lot of stories change titles when they change languages), and quite possibly, the German version as well. The DeepL translator tells me that _The Tiger’s Cave_ in Danish is either _Tigerens hule_ or _Tigerens Grotte_. In German, it’s _Die Höhle des Tigers_ or _Die Tigerhöhle_ (with variations in spacing and hyphenation).

### Finding the Original Story

I tried the German first, and quickly hit paydirt. The story “Die Tigerhöhle” appears in the collection [_Apollonia: Eine Sammlung auserlesener Schilderungen_](https://books.google.com/books?id=SxgR0G6Au9QC&pg=PA54&dq=%22Die+Tigerh%C3%B6hle%22+Quito&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q=%22Die%20Tigerh%C3%B6hle%22%20Quito&f=false) (Apollonia: A collection of exquisite descriptions and stories for the instructive entertainment of inquisitive youth), published in 1828 by F. P. Wilmsen. Searching a bit more in the book, I discovered the phrase “die Tigerhöhle von Döring” (the Tiger’s Cave from Döring) in the introduction, which verifies the author credit.

So now, we know the story dates back to at least 1828, though since _Apollonia_ is an anthology, I don’t think that this is the original publication. It may, however, be the source that Elmquist and/or the ELJ translator used, since the ELJ attribution parallels the _Apollonia_ attribution in its lack of a first name.{% marginnote "corbett", "The translator of the ELJ version is one of the so-called [\“Misses Corbett\”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misses_Corbett), the collective name for the two Scottish sisters Walterina Cunningham and Grace Corbett. The sisters jointly produced the anthologies _The Odd Volume_ (Vol 1 1826, Vol II 1827) and _Tales and Legends_ (1828), along with a number of other anthologies, novels, poems and plays. They seem to have been familiar with the contemporary British fad for German gothic, and it makes sense that at least one of them would be literate enough in German to translate. Whether they knew Danish, I don’t know." %}

But who is this Döring? I don’t know for sure, but my guess is someone named “Georg Döring.” At the Internet Archive, I found what appears to be a literary almanac (a year-end collection of stories) by a “Dr. Georg Döring” called [_Phantasiegemälde für 1828_](https://archive.org/details/phantasiegemlde00drgoog/page/n7/mode/2up) (Fantasy painting for 1828), which does sound like it would contain stories of the appropriate genre. It does not contain “Die Tigerhöhle”.

Dr Döring may or may not be [Georg Christian Wilhelm Asmus Döring](https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/ADB:D%C3%B6ring,_Georg_Christian_Wilhelm_Asmus), the author of the also rather pulpy-sounding _Die Mumie von Rotterdam_ (The Mummy of Rotterdam), and a few other works that may be in a similar vein, at least judging by the [titles at Projekt Gutenberg-DE](https://www-projekt--gutenberg-org.translate.goog/autoren/namen/doering.html?_x_tr_sl=auto&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en-US&_x_tr_pto=wapp).

This is as far as I got. We know the original story, approximately when it was published, and we have a good guess at the author. This is not quite all the way to the answer, but it's pretty far! Especially considering that I don’t even like this story….

**EDIT**: Right after I hit "publish" on this post, I realized a logical hole: I'm not _positive_ the story went from German to Danish. It's also possible that Döring translated a story that he read in _Laesefrugter_. We can't know until we know when Elmquist published the story. But I think German to Danish is the more likely direction

### Holes Yet to Be Patched

In addition to not being entirely confident of the author’s identity, we still don’t know when (or where) “Die Tigerhöhle” first appeared; I imagine it was around 1827-1828. We also don’t know when it appeared in _Laesefrugter_. Some creative internet querying led me to the Royal Danish Library, and I believe they [might have a copy of the appropriate volume online](https://soeg.kb.dk/discovery/search?query=any,contains,L%C3%A6sefrugter%20Elmquist&tab=Everything&search_scope=MyInst_and_CI&vid=45KBDK_KGL:KGL&facet=tlevel,include,open_access&offset=0), but I won’t be able to find it; anyone who is fluent in Danish is more than welcome to try. Again, my guess is that the appropriate year would be 1827 or 1828.

Nor do we know who is responsible for the English translation in _The Monthly Magazine_.

So there we have it! Any Danish or German literary sleuths who feel like verifying my work or filling in any holes, please do. And thank you, Tara Challoner!
