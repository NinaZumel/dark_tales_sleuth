The Internet Archive is a treasure trove that sometimes gives up wonderful little delights: "Spukenswald" is one such gem. I found it while excavating the Christmas 1909 issue of a magazine called [_The Scrap Book_](https://archive.org/details/thescrapbookv08n06190912). I wrote about this on _Multo_, but since my research into the provenance of the tale (which was unattributed in _The Scrap Book_) turned up something interesting, I thought I'd share it here, too.

> \[“Spukenswald is\] a Grand Guignol romp that’s got all the fixings: a haunted castle, a magic talisman, a mysterious lady, a young man on a quest, wizards, revenants, robbers, even cannibals! ...
> 
> Although The Scrap Book presents the story as an anonymous “Ghost Story Translated from the German,” it’s actually an American-authored pastiche/spoof of the German gothic literature so popular in the early 19th century. Plus, it has some interesting connections to that great author of American gothic, Edgar Allan Poe.

[Read all about "Spukenswald," its author Lambert Alexander Wilmer, and Edgar Allan Poe over on _Multo_](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2021/06/28/spukenswald/). The post, of course, includes a link to the original story. Good bloody fun! Do enjoy.
