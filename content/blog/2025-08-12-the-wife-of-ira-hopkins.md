We're almost to the end of the Dr. Immanuel stories, by Victor Rousseau!

In [**"The Wife of Ira Hopkins,"**](/victor-rousseau/wife-of-ira-hopkins/) Dr. Immanuel attempts to treat a young woman who has been hypnotized into believing that she's married to a man she barely knows. Seems like an easy case, doesn't it? But the ways of "the existence beneath our incarnations" are more complex than we might realize....

This tale, in my opinion, is particularly ludicrous, and a bit classist, too. But it was amusing to see Dr. Immanuel get a comeuppance, of sorts.

You can find pointers to all the Dr. Immanuel stories that I've transcribed or linked to so far, at the [project page](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-phileas-immanuel-tracer-of-egos).
