I think of "[The Gored Huntsman](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n34/mode/2up)" as a gothic fairytale. It's the story of a German huntsman who gets lost in the forest, and comes upon a mysterious dwelling. Within this dwelling is a beautiful but somewhat sinister woman who permits him to shelter there for the night. There are aspects of the story that remind me of the myth of [Diana/Artemis and Actaeon](http://www.talesbeyondbelief.com/myth-stories/diana-actaeon.htm), though it isn't a direct retelling.

"The Gored Huntsman" was originally published in [_The Keepsake for 1828_,](https://books.google.com/books?id=B-sNAAAAQAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false) published November 1827. This was the first issue of a literary annual that ran from 1828 to 1857, and was made up of original fiction, poetry, essays and engraved illustrations. _The Keepsake_ came out every year around Christmas, perfect for use as a gift-book.

Literary annuals like _The Keepsake_ were aimed at middle-class readers, particularly women, and were not esteemed by the literati. No doubt because of this, contributions to the 1828 _Keepsake_ were all anonymous. A "serious" author or poet wouldn't want to embarrass themselves by openly publishing in venues that their peers and literary critics held in such disdain.

However, the 1828 _Keepsake_ did so well, and the editors of _The Keepsake_ paid so well, that by the 1829 issue several prominent writers swallowed their pride and began contributing pieces, mostly by name. Contributors for 1829 included Wordsworth, Walter Scott (as "The author of _Waverley_"), Coleridge, and Mary Shelley (as "The author of _Frankenstein_").

There were at least a few works by prominent writers in the 1828 issue, and several pieces have been attributed. Unfortunately, [according to the Curran Index](http://www.curranindex.org/articles?page=1&search%5Barticle_year%5D%5B%5D=1827+-+1827&search%5Bperiodical%5D%5B%5D=39&per_page=50), "The Gored Huntsman" isn't one of them. If all those well-equipped scholars can't figure it out, there's not much chance I can either. It's likely the author was not a well-known one.

And since we don't know who wrote it, we don't know whether it's a translation, or simply a pastiche of the German gothic and Romantic tales that were popular at the time. In any case, it serves as a nice, thematically consistent follow-up to "[The Magic Dice.](/blog/2020-09-19-notes-on-the-magic-dice/)"
