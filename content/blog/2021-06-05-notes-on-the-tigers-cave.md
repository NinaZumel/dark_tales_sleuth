Investigating "[The Tiger's Cave](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n246/mode/2up)" was more interesting than the story itself.

I dislike this story. It's a straightforward South American adventure yarn that reminds me a bit of pulp fiction from the early twentieth century, with an exotic native damsel and intrepid white explorers. This in itself is not necessarily a deal-breaker for me, but the story also includes some animal cruelty that I just found, well, gross. I wasn't entirely looking forward to tackling, or writing about, this case.

But the research uncovered a couple of interesting people that I hadn't known about before, and that makes writing this post fun again.

"The Tiger's Cave" first appeared in [_The Monthly Magazine_, March 1831 (New Series Volume 11, Number 63)](https://archive.org/details/monthlymagazineo11lond/page/256/mode/2up). The editors credit the narrative to "A.F. Elmquist, of Copenhagen." However, I'm not sure Elmquist _wrote_ the story....

### Adolph Frederik Elmquist

Adolph Frederik Elmquist (1788 - 1868) was a Danish publisher and editor. He came to prominence as editor of _Aarhus Stiftstidende_[^1], a post he acquired in about 1811. During his tenure the periodical's readership increased from 400 to 3000 subscribers, apparently due to his choice of "entertaining and interesting" content. In 1818 he founded the literary magazine _Læsefrugter, samling paa Literaturens Mark_ (Fruits of Reading, a collection from the field of Literature), publishing a total of 66 volumes between 1818-1840.[^2]

_Læsefrugter_, and probably also _Aarhus Stiftstidende_, leaned towards popular literature: tales of adventure, crime, and murder, what the [Danish Biographical Lexicon](https://biografiskleksikon.lex.dk/A._F._Elmquist) snootily refers to as "fairly ordinary entertainment" (according to the [Google translation](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=da&u=https://biografiskleksikon.lex.dk/A._F._Elmquist&prev=search&pto=aue), anyway). The journal primarily published translations[^3] of well-known foreign authors, along with original material from Danish authors, including Hans Christian Andersen and Bernhard Severin Ingemann. Notably, _Læsefrugter_ published some of the first short stories by Steen Steensen Blicher, who went on to write what is considered the first modern crime novel, [_The Rector of Veilbye_](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2013/03/20/reading-the-rector-of-veilbye-the-first-modern-crime-novel/) (1829).

Elmquist was more of a publisher/editor than a writer; but various biographies I've found do imply that he contributed to his own periodicals on occasion. So it's possible that Elmquist wrote "The Tiger's Cave." However, I found no evidence that Elmquist was either interested in or knowledgeable about South America, and none of the characters in the story have Danish sounding names. So I'm inclined to think that "The Tiger's Cave" is actually an English translation/adaptation of a story from _Læsefrugter_. And since I don't read Danish, I can't take the investigation farther than that.

\[UPDATE January 2024: Thanks to Tara Challoner, I got a little farther and found an earlier German version of this story. Read about it [here](/blog/2024-01-02-revisiting-the-tigers-cave/).  \]

### Richard Phillips and _The Monthly Magazine_

[_The Monthly Magazine or British Register_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monthly_Magazine) was an English periodical founded in 1796 by [Sir Richard Phillips](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Phillips_\(publisher\)), best known today as an early "[vegetarian activist](https://archive.org/details/b30389380)." As Geoffrey Carnall puts it, _The Monthly Magazine_ was "the journal of the Dissenters, the Unitarians--radicals in religion and politics alike," founded to propagate liberal principles "against the forces of panic conservatism". [^4]

Beyond its politics, the magazine also has an interesting literary history. It was the original intended venue for _The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,_ and published the work of notable authors including Samuel Coleridge, Robert Southey, and William Taylor of Norwich. Some of Charles Dickens' early fiction appeared in _The Monthly_.

In 1825 Phillips sold off the _The Monthly Magazine_, which by that time was becoming unprofitable. The following year the new owners began a new series (restarting it from Volume One), and downplayed the magazine's political nature. By Volume 9 of the new series (1830), the editorial staff completely disavowed the politics of _The Monthly's_ founders, asserting the revamped magazine's fealty to "the Crown, the Constitution, and the Religion of the Empire" \[[_Preface to the Ninth Volume_](https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/2448818#page/9/mode/1up)\].

"The Tiger's Cave" appeared in the new series run of _The Monthly Magazine_, so Phillips is a bit out of scope for this article. Still, I found him and the history of the magazine interesting enough to mention, so I did it anyway!
