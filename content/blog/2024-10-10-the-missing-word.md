A new Austin Philips story: ["The Missing Word"](/austin-philips/the-missing-word/), from *Pall Mall Magazine*, November 1907. This one is supernatural. 

It's a stormy midnight, and several telegraph operators sit together in the telegraph office, awaiting for the moment they must broadcast the news of the Prime Minister's imminent death. Old Shayler passes the time by telling his colleagues about the night he "heard" the murder of a fellow telegraphist--over the wire. The murderer will never be found. Or will he?

This is the story that Mike Ashley included in his 2018 anthology *Glimpses of the Unknown*. It can also be found in Philips's collection *Red Tape*, from 1910, under the title "The Act of God."

It's a good one. Enjoy!
