For the new year, I'm starting a new literary excavation project, which I'll be announcing on *Multo* soon.

*Tales of an Antiquary: chiefly illustrative of the manners, traditions, and remarkable localities of ancient London* is a three-volume collection of stories, with a frame, by antiquarian [Richard Thomson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thomson_(antiquarian)). Thomson took several pieces that he'd originally published in a defunct periodical, revised and extended them, and wove them into the rambling memoirs of the fictional antiquarian, Sylvanus Beauclerk.

While many of the stories are quite interesting, the work as a whole is tedious and verbose---an opinion shared by contemporary reviewers:

> We think the author has been led away by a false idea of conforming to the taste of the times, of writing a popular work, yet so full of his antiquarian lore that the mere story-teller sinks under the weight.<br>
      --- Review in *The Literary Gazette, and Journal of the Belles Lettres*, January 26, 1828

So, I've unearthed a few of the stories from the overall work that I really like, and I'll be presenting them here.
I'll start with [three stories from Volume One](/pages/tales-of-an-antiquary/#volume-1). One of them is possibly the first Gothic
werewolf story ever published, and it's been reposted over at *Roy Glanshan's Library*. The other two are reposted here
at *Dark Tales Sleuth*, and I've added some light annotations.

I'll be presenting stories from the other volumes soon as well. I hope you enjoy them!
