> A certain merchant had three sons; the eldest was named SÃ¡lih, the second Selim, and the youngest Judar.

So opens "[The Story of Judar](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n98/mode/2up)," from Volume One of _Evening Tales for the Winter_. It's the story of a young man who gains some magic artifacts from a Maghrebi magician, and uses them to make his way in the world. In many ways, it's a tale quite similar to the more famous "Aladdin."

A little websearching easily revealed that this story is from _The Thousand and One Nights_; search for it and up pops the version from Richard Burton's famous translation, from the 1880's. He titled it ["Judar and his Brethren"](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/3440/3440-h/3440-h.htm#chap39).

But of course, the version from _Evening Tales_ can't be Burton's, since _Evening Tales_ Volume One was originally published in 1833 (as Volume One of _Tales of Terror_). Looking further back, the only other English version I could find of this story was from a translation by [Edward William Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_William_Lane), called ["The Story of Joudar"](https://archive.org/details/thousandonenight00lane/page/480/mode/2up), first published sometime in the period 1838-1840 -- so also not early enough.

After further reading, I found an article by folklorist (and entomologist) [William Forsell Kirby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Forsell_Kirby), called [_Contributions to the Bibliography of the Thousand and One Nights, and Their Imitations, with a Table Showing the Contents of the Principal Editions and Translations of the Nights_](https://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Vol_10/appendix2.htm). It's included as Appendix II of [Volume 10](https://www.wollamshram.ca/1001/Vol_10/vol10.htm) of Burton's _The Book of The Thousand Nights and A Night_. In the section "Von Hammer's MS., and the Translations Derived From It," Kirby discusses the manuscript associated with German orientalist [Joseph von Hammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_von_Hammer-Purgstall).

Von Hammer translated some of the as-yet unpublished tales from the manuscript into French, and later had (some? all?) of the tales translated into German by August Ernst Zinserling. This German work was published in 1824. A selection of the tales were translated into English by one Rev. George Lamb, and published as _New Arabian Nights' Entertaiments_, three volumes, in 1826.

It's not clear whether Lamb translated directly from the Arabic manuscript or from Zinserling's German translation. I suspect the latter. But the important part is: Lamb's work was published before 1833! Eureka!!!

Sure enough, "The Story of Judar" as reprinted in _Tales of Terror_ and later _Evening Tales for Winter_ can be found in [Volume One](https://archive.org/details/newarabiannight00nighgoog/page/n6/mode/2up) of Lamb's translation.

I believe this is the first appearance of the Judar story in English, as all other English translations of _The Thousand and One Nights_ that I could find are based on an 18th century French translation by [Antoine Galland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Galland), which does not appear to have the Judar tale.

Case closed!

Incidentally, Kirby also mentions a story called "[Joodar of Cairo and Mahmood of Tunis"](https://archive.org/details/newarabiannights00kirbrich/page/124/mode/2up?q=joodar), from [Gustav Weil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_Weil)'s translation of _1001 Nights_ into German (1837-41). It's the same basic story, but with vastly different plot elements and narrative. Weil claims to have taken it "from a MS. in the Ducal Library at Gotha" \[Kirby, _Contributions..._\]. Kirby translated the story and included it in his 1883 collection _The New Arabian Nights: Select Tales Not Included by Galland or Lane_.
