Another Victor Rousseau story: in [**"The Professor's Peach Trees,"**](/victor-rousseau/professors-peach-trees/) Dr. Immanuel tells his friends the story of a woman who was reincarnatedâ€”as a plant! Several plants, to be exact: peach trees, and flowers.

The story also mentions the remarkable ship-guiding dolphin named Pelorus Jack, who really existed. I've got further links about Pelorus Jack in the margin notes of the text.

The next Dr. Immanuel story to appear in *The Evening Republican* was "Mr. Axel's Shady Past." This one had some expressions of misogyny that I really disliked, so I won't transcribe the story. If you are curious about it, I do link to the story over at the *Hoosier State Chronicles* archive. You can find that link, as well as all the Dr. Immanuel stories that I've transcribed or linked to so far, at the [project page](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-phileas-immanuel-tracer-of-egos).
