I haven't forgotten about my Austin Philips project! Here's another Post Office crime story, from *The Strand*, February 1912.

In ["Not in the Newspapers,"](/austin-philips/not-in-the-newspapers/) a plucky postal clerk named Miss Gale becomes
embroiled in a situation of international significance.

This is a story much of its era, but I love the character of Miss Gale! It would have been fun to have had a continuing series of
her adventures, especially if Philips could have worked her Post Office knowledge into the stories.

But at least we have this one. Do enjoy!
