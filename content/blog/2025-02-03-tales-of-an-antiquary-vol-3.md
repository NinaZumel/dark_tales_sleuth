I've collected three stories from [Volume 3](/pages/tales-of-an-antiquary/#volume-3) of Richard Thomson's *Tales of an Antiquary* for you to enjoy!

Volume Three covers the period from 1716-1769. The conceit in this volume is that the narrator of *Tales*, Sylvanus Beauclerk, has discovered the notes and memoirs of an astrologer of the period, named Ptolemy Horoscope. The tales told in Volume Three come from Horoscope's notes, and Horoscope himself is a character in two of the stories I'm sharing today.

These are the best stories from the entire anthology, in my opinion. I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

And with this, the case is complete!
