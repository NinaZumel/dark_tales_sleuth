* * *

The Carmer pieces are in the 1956 collection [_The Screaming Ghost and Other Stories_](https://www.amazon.com/screaming-ghost-other-stories/dp/B0007E17X8). I feel like I've heard or read "The Lone Grave" before, but it seems to be a common urban legend, as was "The Lavender Evening Dress," which Price read on [_A Graveyard of Ghost Tales_](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2020/09/14/a-graveyard-of-ghost-tales-1974/). And I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the versions of either of these pieces that you can find on the internet derive originally from either Price's readings, or Carmer's original literary renditions.

[Alan Garner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Garner) was an award-winning author of fantasy novels, much of it aimed at children and young adults. His work was rooted in British folklore, and he compiled several folkloric collections as well. "The Smoker" and "Gobbleknoll" appear to be from Garner's anthology [_The Hamish Hamilton Book of Goblins_](http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/pl.cgi?360630) (aka _A Book of Goblins_/_A Cavalcade of Goblins_), first published in 1969 and illustrated by [Krystyna Turksa](http://the--dream--machine.blogspot.com/2016/06/artist-profile-krystyna-turska.html). It looks fascinating; I shall have to try to get my hands on it.

> "Graunt that no Hobgoblins fright me, No hungry devils rise up and bite me; ..." -- John Day

_A Book of Goblins_ also includes a Prayer (or "Prayer for Protection"), attributed to English dramatist [John Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Day_\(dramatist\)). You can find the prayer [here](https://books.google.com/books?id=NnMA_M9mDW8C&pg=PA242&lpg=PA242&dq=%22john+day%22+hobgoblin+prayer&source=bl&ots=VmZkObsq1O&sig=ACfU3U35zTK2DGyOlk2QEf30kTteNGXP0g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwif3f2cmOjkAhUPIjQIHRoCDqkQ6AEwCnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=%22john%20day%22%20hobgoblin%20prayer&f=false), as well. Price gives a lovely reading of it.

"To Become A Werewolf" appears to be adapted from Chapter IV, ["How to Become a Werwolf"](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/26629/26629-h/26629-h.htm#Page_55) from _Werwolves_ (1912) by [Elliot O'Donnell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_O'Donnell), ghost hunter and author of several "true-life" books about ghosts and other supernatural phenomena. O'Donnell's piece isn't a perfect correspondence to what Price reads, but it's quite close. Perhaps O'Donnell published a slightly different version of the chapter elsewhere.

"To Raise the Dead" is adapted from a passage from [Chapter IX](https://www.sacred-texts.com/grim/magus/ma131.htm) of _The Magus_ (1801), which sacred-texts.com calls "one of the rarest and most sought after of the 19th century grimoires." The author of _The Magus_, the occultist [Francis Barrett](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/barrett-francis-fl-nineteenth-century), attributes the "recipe" to [Hermes Trismegistus](https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/philosophy-and-religion/ancient-religion-biographies/hermes-trismegistus)

"The Witches' Reel" is a traditional Scottish song/dance. I'm not sure exactly what text Price read from, but [here are the lyrics](https://www.theseventhstring.com/witches-reel), identical to those Price recited. One of the posters on [this thread](https://mudcat.org/thread.cfm?threadid=80264) says that the lyrics of the reel were taken down from the testimony of Agnes Sampson, one of the accused witches during [the North Berwick witch trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Berwick_witch_trials) of 1590. The poster cites David Pickering's _Dictionary of Witchcraft_ as the source of this assertion. I couldn't find any transcription of such testimony online, but a document called [_Newes From Scotland_](https://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/kjd/kjd11.htm) (1591), a contemporary (and anonymous, as far as I can tell) account of the trials describes the testimony of Agnes Sampson (or perhaps it was Agnes Tompson), including the first two lines of the reel.

And finally, "Sweden" comes from an appendix to [Joseph Glanvill's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Glanvill) infamous [_Saducismus Triumphatus_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saducismus_Triumphatus), a 17th century defense of the belief in witchcraft. This work strongly influenced Cotton Mather and his justification for the Salem Witch Trials. The appendix is question is "A Relation of the Strange Witchcraft Discovered in the Village Mohra in Swedeland," by [Anthony Horneck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Horneck). Price actually reads extracts from two sections of the appendix: the beginning of ["Of their Journey to _Blockula_,"](https://archive.org/details/saducismustriump00glan/page/4) and extracts from ["Of the place where they used to assemble, called _Blockula_, and what they did there."](https://archive.org/details/saducismustriump00glan/page/6)
