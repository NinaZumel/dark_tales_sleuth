In [my previous post](/blog/2021-01-18-notes-on-the-astrologer-of-the-nineteenth-century/), I tracked down the origin of the story called "The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century" in Henry St. Clair's anthology _Tales of Terror_/_Evening Tales for the Winter_. That search led me to St. Clair's source: a story entitled "The Necromancer" in the first section of the 1825 astrological tome _The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century_. This first section was likely the first issue of a failed periodical called _The Struggling Astrologer_ (1824), edited by English astrologer Robert Cross Smith.

As I mentioned in that last post, this first issue of _The Struggling Astrologer_ is made up mostly of pieces that appear to be lifted from other literary and occult sources. This makes it rather like one of those [Caedmon Records of spooky readings by Vincent Price](/pages/vincent-price-and-caedmon-records/). So of course, I had to track them down. And here they are! Try imagining Vincent Price's eerie voice as you read them.

The first story is "[**The Necromancer**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/n41/mode/2up)," the subject of [my previous post](/blog/2021-01-18-notes-on-the-astrologer-of-the-nineteenth-century/).

Next is "[**Der Frieschutz**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/62/mode/2up)," August Apel's tale from Volume One of _Gestpensterbuch_ (Ghost Book). This is NOT [the translation by Thomas De Quincey that appeared in _Evening Tales for the Winter, Volume One_](/blog/2020-10-01-notes-on-der-freischutz/). I think it may be a retelling of the story, or of the opera of the same name. 

"[**Valmondi, or the Unhallowed Sepulchre**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/72/mode/2up)" is a discussion of James T. Rodwell's play _Valmondi_, which is based on the novel [_Melmoth the Wanderer_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melmoth_the_Wanderer), by Charles Maturin. [_Valmondi_ opened at The Adelphi Theater in London on October 14, 1824](https://www.umass.edu/AdelphiTheatreCalendar/m24d.htm#Label001), and ran until December 2 of that year. I couldn't find another source for this article, so it's possible that it is original to _The Struggling Astrologer_.

"[**Life in Death, or the Spectre Wife**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/76/mode/2up)" is an excerpt from the essay "[A Tale for a Chimney Corner](https://archive.org/details/essayshunt00hunt/page/n37/mode/2up)" by [Leigh Hunt](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leigh-Hunt), the English essayist, poet, and journalist (the story itself starts at the last paragraph of the first column of page 28). "A Tale for a Chimney Corner" first appeared in the weekly periodical _The Indicator_, which Hunt edited from 1819-1821.

"[**Invocation of Spirits, a Fragment**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/82/mode/2up)" purports to be an appendix to [John Dee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee)'s Conferences with Angels (MS 3677 Sloan Library, British Museum). It consists of entries from Dee's diaries covering October 16 to 23, 1585. They describe Dee's experiments with a scrying crystal and seal (likely [this one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee#/media/File:John_Dee's_Seal_of_God.jpg), from the description).

I could not verify that these entries are authentic. This particular manuscript is not online (and judging from some other manuscripts, it would be fairly illegible if it were). I could not find these entries in Méric Casaubon's [_A true and faithful relation of what passed for many years between Dr. John Dee and Some Spirits_](https://archive.org/details/truefaithfulrela00deej/page/170/mode/2up), which should cover the portion of Dee's diaries that include the period in question. I also checked _The Private Diary of Dr. John Dee,_ edited by James Orchard Halliwell. These diary entries skip right over 1585.

{% image "./images/valmondi.png", "Scene of man carried off by the devil, from the play Valmondi.", "60vw" %}

Nor could I find the text of these entries from any other source online earlier than _The Astrologer of the Nineteenth Century_. So, regardless of whether these are authentic writings of John Dee (they still could be), this could be the original appearance of this particular version of them.

"[**The Magic Dice**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/84/mode/2up)" is a translation by Thomas de Quincey of Friedrich Laun's 1814 “Die Glückswürfel.” It appeared in _The London Magazine_, August 1823. It also appeared in _Evening Tales for the Winter, Volume One_, and I wrote about it [here](/blog/2020-09-19-notes-on-the-magic-dice/).

"[**Awful Apparition of the Chevalier de Saxe**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/112/mode/2up)" is attributed to a T. M. Jarvis, Esq. However, it is actually from [_Memoirs of the courts of Berlin, Dresden, Warsaw, and Vienna, in the years 1777, 1778, and 1779_](https://archive.org/details/memoirsofcourtso01wraxiala/page/276/mode/2up), by [Sir Nathaniel William Wraxall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Wraxall), published in 1799 (the story begins in the middle of page 276: "In the great gallery,...").

The story is an account of the supposed raising of the ghost of [Johann Georg, Chevalier de Saxe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg,_Chevalier_de_Saxe) by the German necromancer [Johann Georg Schröpfer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Georg_Schr%C3%B6pfer) in Dresden, at the behest of [Prince Charles of Saxony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_of_Saxony,_Duke_of_Courland).

And finally, "[**The Midnight Storm**](https://archive.org/details/astrologerofnine00raph/page/118/mode/2up)" is by Sarah Elizabeth Utterson, included (as "The Storm") in her volume _Tales of the Dead_ (1813), which is mostly her translation of _Fantasmagoriana_ (1812), by Jean-Baptiste Benoît Eyriès.

_Fantasmagoriana_ is in turn translations from the German of eight supernatural tales, mostly from _Gespensterbuch_. It is most famous for being the reading material of Mary Shelley and John Polidori during the rainy summer when they wrote, respectively, _Frankenstein_ and _The Vampyre_. You can read more about _Tales of the Dead_ [at my post on _Multo_, here](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2020/08/20/tales-of-the-dead/).

And that's it! The first issue of _The Struggling Astrologer_ may not have been the most useful information for aspiring star-scryers, but it certainly provides an evening or two of entertainment for those who like classic gothic ghost stories and other supernatural readings. Enjoy!
