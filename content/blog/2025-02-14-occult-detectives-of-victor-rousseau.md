[Victor Rousseau Emanuel ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Rousseau_Emanuel)(1879-1960) was a British-born journalist, novelist and pulp fiction writer who lived at various times in Britain, South Africa, Canada, and the United States. He wrote fiction in a variety of genres, under several pen names, primarily, "Victor Rousseau". While he might be best known to pulp fiction aficionados for his science-fiction stories and novels, my interest in Rousseau is for his occult detective fiction, in particular his three series: 

* *Ivan Brodsky, Surgeon of Souls*
* *Phineas Immanuel, Tracer of Egos*
* *Dr. Martinus, Occultist*. 

## A Different Flavor of Occult Detective

The worlds in which many fictional occult detectives operate are filled with ghosts, demons, monsters, and evil spirits that are based on traditional folkloric conceptions of these creatures, or on made-up demonologies. What makes Rousseau's occult detectives unique is that they operate in worlds that are instead based on spiritualist foundations. While the details of the spiritualist "physics" varies from series to series, some common themes repeat. Furthermore, the rules of the world stay remarkably consistent across the stories within a single series, meaning that Rousseau was really thinking his spiritualist system through, not just making up whatever worked for a given story.

Rousseau does reference motifs from various folkloric and religious traditions, but his tales—at least in the first two series—are quite free of traditional ghost hauntings and folkloric creatures. There are no grimoires, no witchcraft, no psychic powers. No Carnacki-style electric pentacles. Just hypnosis, sometimes a séance, and a little bit of Freud. 

### If Reincarnation were real, how might it work?

The foundation of the theory is reincarnation: every person is an eternal soul that periodically is reborn on earth as a different personality. In between lives, the soul inhabits "the other world." where it processes its lived experiences in order to develop and improve itself. Elementals and spirits from the other world can manifest themselves in this world in the way that spiritualism (as it was practiced in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries) describes. 

It's true that spiritualism (and Freud) make these tales somewhat dated, but I love the worldbuilding and the different point of view. I have to confess, sometimes I get a bit bored with monster hunters and polysyllabic demonologies. These spiritualist physicians make a nice change from the more prevalent flavors of occult or psychic detectives. 

Rousseau's first series occult detective was Ivan Brodsky, whose stories date back to 1909. This makes him one of the earliest occult detectives, appearing a little bit after Algernon Blackwood's *John Silence* (1908), and roughly contemporaneously with William Hope Hodgson's *Carnacki the Ghost Finder*. Brodsky is probably the best known of Rousseau's occult detectives, but he still isn't as well known as Silence or Carnacki, so I'd like to give him (and the others) a shoutout.

## The Surgeon of Souls

 Dr. Ivan Brodsky is a Polish professor of Nervous Diseases who has immigrated to the United States. He seeks to treat mental illness with a controversial methodology, based on the idea that reincarnation and spiritualist phenomena are governed by real, empirical principles. In his view, the majority of cases of mental illness can be straightforwardly explained---and treated---via these principles.

Naturally, this doesn't sit well with his peers and colleagues. But they can't explain his amazing success....
### A Spiritualist Theory of Mental Illness

The story "The Legacy of Hate" opens with Dr. Brodsky miraculously curing 200 of the 350 patients in a single asylum. We also get a breakdown of the causes of mental illness, according to the doctor's theory:

1\. Brain damage or brain disease. These are physical causes, and not treatable by Dr. Brodsky's methods.

2\. "The strings of [a person's] personalities becom[ing] tangled." This is when a soul's past personalities emerge and interfere with the present one, manifesting as phobias or what we now call disassociative identity disorder. Brodsky treats these cases with hypnosis, to reintegrate the disparate personalities.

3\. Possession. This is when "discarnate entities," who can be elementals or the spirits of dead people, attempt to take over a physical body, evicting or submerging the personality who inhabits it. Also treated with hypnosis and other, sometimes more dramatic, measures.

The second cause is supposed to be the most common, but the third cause is the arguably the most interesting, so of course those are the cases that Brodsky's "Watson" tends to record. The Watson in this case is an unnamed medical colleague of Brodsky's, who becomes his personal secretary and a believer in Brodsky's theories. 
### The Stories

 The earliest known publication of this series was in the *Stevens Point Journal*, a Wisconsin newspaper. From 1910 through 1911, eleven stories appeared under the byline H.M. Egbert. However, it's possible that the tales could have been published before their appearance in the *Stevens Point Journal*, since they were marked with a copyright date of 1909.

Starting in 1926, and running until mid-1927, *Weird Tales* reprinted ten of the eleven Brodsky stories, along with a new one to introduce the series. By this time, of course, occult detectives were fairly common--the September 1926 issue, with the first *Surgeon of Souls* installment, also included a Jules de Grandin tale (by Seabury Quinn). However, I still think the Brodsky stories stood out from the crowd. 

In 2006, Spectre Library published a collection of all twelve known[^1] stories, called *Surgeon of Souls*. It's now out of print. But for your reading pleasure, I've compiled [a list of links to all the stories (mainly the *Weird Tales* versions), here](http://localhost:8081/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-ivan-brodsky-surgeon-of-souls). I've also transcribed the twelfth story, "Homo Homunculus," from the *Stevens Point Journal*, since the scan at the Internet Archive is a little hard to read. 

[^1]:  In 2011, Spectre Library published a volume of Rousseau-iana called [*His Second Self*](http://www.darkfantasy.org/spectre/HisSecondSelf.html). This volume contains a previously unknown Ivan Brodsky tale, making thirteen in total. Not having that book, I don't know when or where this last story first appeared, so I will only discuss the twelve previously known tales here.

The list also includes links to an audiobook collection, and a 2009 ebook collection of the eleven stories published in *Weird Tales*.

If you've never read these stories, before, now is your chance to check them out! Do enjoy. 

Next up: Phileas Immanuel, Tracer of Egos.
