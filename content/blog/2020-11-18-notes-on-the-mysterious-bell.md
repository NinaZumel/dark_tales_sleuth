"[The Mysterious Bell](https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/themysteriousbell.pdf)" is a short, enigmatic tale that feels like the beginning of an unfinished story, but I like it. It reminds me a bit of the spooky sea tales of William Hope Hodgson, or of the Belgian writer Jean Ray. It also has hints of what could be science fiction elements.

> It came careering over the waters with a rapid motion, and as it drew near, exhibited to our wondering gaze a single black mast, rising from the centre of what seemed a square and solid block of wood, but without yard or sail, nor did any living creature appear upon it.

Science fiction or ghost story or both -- it is not only intriguing for the mystery within the narrative, but as a literary sleuthing puzzle, too.

It took only a little internet search to notice that the story had been floating around U.S. newspapers quite a bit in early-mid 1828, after having appeared in the weekly _New-York Mirror and Ladies Literary Gazette_ for October 20, 1827. The _New-York Mirror_ had this to say:

> The following is copied from an old newspaper. We transcribe it for the edification of those who delight in "tales of the wild and wonderful." Of the subject-matter we say nothing; but as a specimen of composition, it is vastly superior to the productions of ordinary newspaper writing.

I found another little burst of publication around mid-1825. Eventually the Library of Congress newspaper archives gave me the earliest version I could find, from _The Phenix Gazette_, an Alexandria, Virginia (District of Columbia) paper, dated May 10, 1825. This version, titled "The Mysterious Bell: A Fragment" was attributed to _The New York Statesman_, and signed "B."

And that was as far as I got, because _The New York Stateman_ isn't online. I asked for help from the Facebook group The Classic Ghost Story Tradition, and finally, thanks to Christopher Philippo, we got it:

"The Mysterious Bell -- A Fragment," marked "For the Statesman" and signed "B.", appeared in _The New-York Statesman_, April 29, 1825.

[![Clipping from the original publication of "The Mysterious Bell"](http://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mysteriousbell_clip.png "MysteriousBell_clip.png")](http://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/mysteriousbell_clip.png)

Beyond that, it cannot be traced. Is this the original publication? Who is "B."? Was this fragment indeed the start of an abortive attempt at a novel or longer story? We may never know.

The spelling of "centre" in the quote from the story above is interesting, as it suggests a non-US origin of either the story and/or of "B." And I will note that I found the story in the _Sydney \[Australia\] Gazette_ for June 8, 1827 -- well after its original (as far as we know) publication, but before its appearance in _The Mirror_. This is the only non-US publication of the tale I found in my search.

Thanks to:

- Christopher Philippo, editor of this year's [_Valancourt Book of Victorian Christmas Ghost Stories_](https://www.valancourtbooks.com/the-valancourt-book-of-victorian-christmas-ghost-stories-4.html) (featuring stories from the New World!), for tracking the earliest-that-we-know-of publication of this story down.
- [Alistair Gunn](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B00LPJ3HV4), editor of the _Wimbourne Book of Victorian Ghost Stories_ series, who found an April 30, 1825 version of the story (credited to the _Statesman_) in the _Daily National Journal_, another DC paper.
- [Tim Prasil](https://brombonesbooks.com/), who has edited quite a few spooky collections, and written some ghosthunter stories, too, for searching Newspapers.com.
- Anyone else from The Classic Ghost Story Tradition group who took a crack at this, for joining along in the fun.
- Thanks also to Vincent Golden, Curator of Newspapers and Periodicals at the [American Antiquarian Society](https://americanantiquarian.org/), who also tracked down a scan of the _New-York Stateman_ publication for me because I hadn't noticed that Christopher Philippo had already sent me one. Silly me.
