Over on *Multo*, I've got an assembly of haunted stump stories. Ghostly hands, spiritual voices, and cursed disasters abound. I'm sure there are more such tales out there, but these are the ones I've found so far.

> While trawling the HathiTrust archive the other day, I stumbled on a delighful, privately-published little booklet called *The Haunted Stump; or The Story of The Amputated Hand*, by Erasmus Foster Darby. The book gives two versions of an Ohio ghost story about phantom hands that clutch out at the people who pass a spooky old tree stump. Good, campfire tale stuff!
