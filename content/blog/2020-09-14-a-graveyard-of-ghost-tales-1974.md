[Carl Carmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Carmer) was, according to Wikipedia, "one of America's most popular writers during the 1940s and 1950s." He lived for many years in Alabama, and is possibly most famous for his book _Stars Fell on Alabama_. The Carmer stories that Price reads can be found in the 1956 collection [_The Screaming Ghost and Other Stories_](https://www.amazon.com/screaming-ghost-other-stories/dp/B0007E17X8). They sound like literary retellings of folktales and urban legends, with lots of local color, in the Lafcadio Hearn vein. In fact, a few of the tales (either on this LP or on the following one) are set in or around New Orleans, where Hearn lived for a while, and I wondered while listening if they _were_ Hearn stories.

The _Petit Albert_ is an eighteenth century French grimoire attributed to [Albertus Magnus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_Magnus). It has apparently never been translated into English, and it's likely that the producers of this LP found the "recipes" for the Hand of Glory and the Magic Candle in [_Witchcraft, Magic, and Alchemy_](https://www.amazon.com/Witchcraft-Magic-Alchemy-Dover-Occult/dp/0486224937), the 1931 translation of _Musée des sorciers, mages et alchimistes_ (1929) by the French historian and occultist [Émile-Jules Grillot de Givry](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=&sl=fr&tl=en&u=https%3A%2F%2Ffr.m.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2F%C3%89mile-Jules_Grillot_de_Givry), which quotes the relevant passages from the _Petit Albert_.

Discogs credits "The Ghostly Hand of Spital House" to Dorothy Gladys Spicer, from her 1965 book _13 Ghosts_. Unfortunately, Dorothy Gladys Spicer is **not** [this Dorothy Spicer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothy_Spicer), the aviatrix and first woman to get an advanced certification in aeronautical engineering (go, women in STEM!). I can't find any biographical information on the author of _13 Ghosts_, so she will have to be known by her works. Here's her [book publication list from Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/authors/OL710785A/Dorothy_Gladys_Spicer?sort=old#editions) (click "everything" to get all the entries, and not just ebooks), and here's [her entry at the FictionMags Index](http://www.philsp.com/homeville/FMI/d/d5249.htm#A187195).

"The Leg of Gold" is a French variation of the Aarne-Thompson type 366 family of folktales, usually known collectively as "The Golden Arm." Obviously, different limbs feature in different versions of the story. Our best guess is that the version Price read is a retelling by Ruth Manning-Sanders, from _A Book of Ghosts & Goblins_ (1968). You can find a less elaborate, but fundamentally equivalent, version in Wilson M. Hudson's essay ["I Want My Golden Arm,"](https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc38314/m1/189/) from _Folk Travelers: Ballads, Tales, and Talk_ (1953), edited by Mody C. Boatright, Wilson M. Hudson, and Allen Maxwell. The story, from Gascony, is on page 186 of the version of the book I've linked to, but I recommend you read the whole essay, because it's quite interesting.
