Way back in February, I introduced the occult detective (or better, "occult physician") series [Dr. Phileas Immanuel, Tracer of Egos](/blog/2025-02-26-phileas-immanuel-tracer-of-egos/), by Victor Rousseau. I've gotten sidetracked by a lot of things since then, 
but I haven't forgotten it! So here's another Dr. Immanuel tale.

In [The Carfax Curse](/victor-rousseau/carfax-curse/), Dr. Immanuel and his unnamed chronicler meet Sir John Carfax, whose family has suffered 
under a curse since the 16th century. This curse kills the first-born son in every generation, and Sir John's son is next. Can Dr. Immanuel find a way to defeat the curse?

A passing remark in the story reminded me of the real-life research of Dr. Ian Stevenson. I've mentioned it in a margin note to the text. 

Do enjoy!
