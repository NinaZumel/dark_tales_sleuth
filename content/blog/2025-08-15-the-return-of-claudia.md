Finishing up with Dr. Immanuel...

The last *Tracer of Egos* story to appear in *The Evening Republican* was [**"The Return of Claudia,"**](/victor-rousseau/return-of-claudia/) on April 18, 1917. In this tale, Dr. Immanuel must deal with a case of dissociative identity disorder: "Gladys" and "Claudia." And Claudia wants to murder Gladys's fiance.

I had fun annotating this story. We have quotations from Plato and Shakespeare, and a reference to a folktale motif that I've written about (in fact, [retold](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2015/05/26/share-and-share-alike-a-russian-folktale/)) before. {% marginnote "viy", "Though I think Dr. Immanuel should have referenced Nikolai Gogol (*Viy*), rather than Hans Christian Andersen, when he referred to the folktale." %} Dr. Immanuel also refers to an actual historical case of disassociative identity disorder, one of the earliest to be diagnosed.

In addition, we get the pleasure of seeing the narrator commit the sort of inspired gaffe that Arthur Hastings, Hercule Poirot's "Watson," regularly made. That is to say, he says something that seems stupid on the face of it, but turns out to actually be genius.

There was one last story, **Noureddin Bey's Sacrifice**, which did not appear in *The Evening Republican*. I don't have a copy to post or link to, but I do know that in it, the current incarnation of Dr. Immanuel leaves this existence. Rousseau did the same thing with his previous occult physician, Dr. Ivan Brodsky. I guess when the man was finished with a series, he wanted to stay finished.

You can find pointers to all the Dr. Immanuel stories that I've transcribed or linked to, at the [project page](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-phileas-immanuel-tracer-of-egos).

Next up: Victor Rousseau's next series, *Dr. Martinus, Occultist*. Stay tuned.
