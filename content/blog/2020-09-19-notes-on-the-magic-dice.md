"[The Magic Dice](https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog/page/n12/mode/2up)" opens up Volume One of _Evening Tales for the Winter_. It's a nice example of the "deal with the devil" story, about a young soldier who is offered a pair of always-lucky dice by what appears to be the ghost of his dead friend.

> "Ah! if but this once I could secure a lucky throw of the dice!" And scarce was the wish uttered, when his comrade Werl, whom he had seen fall by his side in the field of battle, stepped into his cell.

The provenance of this tale is well-documented, but I traced it down anyway. Everett Bleiler's _Guide to Supernatural Fiction_ (1983) erroneously claims the story was written by Thomas De Quincey. It's actually a translation, which first appeared in _The London Magazine_, vol 8, August 1823 as "[The Dice](https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015033845689&view=1up&seq=129)," with neither the author nor translator credited.

We can verify that De Quincey is responsible for the piece via a [1908 De Quincey bibliography](https://archive.org/details/thomasdequincey00greegoog/page/n20/mode/2up). De Quincey himself later attributes the "The Dice" to [Friedrich Laun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Laun) in an incredibly long-winded review of R. P. Gillies' collection of translations, _German Stories_, in _Blackwood's Magazine_, vol 20, December 1826.

Peter Bridgwater, in his book _De Quincey's Gothic Masquerade_ ([p. 57](https://books.google.com/books?id=7EOWf_H61LQC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&lpg=PP1&dq=de%20quincey%20gothic%20masquerade&pg=PA57#v=onepage&q&f=false)), gives us the name of the original story: “Die Glückswürfel” is from Laun's 1814 collection _Die Traumdeutung, Herr Blitz und Die Glückswürfel_ (1814).

Laun wrote a number of works, but is possibly best known today for his collaboration with August Apel on the multivolume _Das Gespensterbuch_ (The Ghost Book), a collection of German supernatural and gothic stories.

If you follow my _Multo_ blog, then you might have read [my article/review](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2020/08/20/tales-of-the-dead/) of _Tales of the Dead_, the English translation of the French translation of German supernatural stories that made up part of Mary Shelley's reading at the Villa Diodati, the summer she wrote _Frankenstein_. I didn't mention it in that article, but three of those tales -- "The Fated Hour", "The Death's Head", and "The Death Bride" -- are all from _Das Gespensterbuch_, and apparently all by Laun. "The Death Bride" is especially enjoyable, at least for my tastes.

Update 20 Sep 2020: Here's [an 1815 review of Laun's collection](https://zs.thulb.uni-jena.de/rsc/viewer/jportal_derivate_00130936/JALZ_1815_Bd.3+4_228_A1.tif). I don't think the reviewer liked "Die Glückswürfel". Ah, well. I enjoyed it.
