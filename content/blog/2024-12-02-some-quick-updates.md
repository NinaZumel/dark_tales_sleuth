Reader Helen Kemp sent in a correction to one of my notes on the story [A Dead Letter](/austin-philips/a-dead-letter/).
The term "pots," as in "to win pots," means "cups, medals, awards for athletic or sporting prowess"---than the "pot" of a poker game, which was my guess.
Thanks, Helen!

Also, over at *Multo*, I've started this year's Winter Tales season. My opening tale, "The Bright Room of Cranmore" seems to be either
an early version, or a plagiarized version, of a story called "Brimg me a Light!" by Jane Margaret Hooper. You can read the details, as well as both
stories, at [this post](https://multoghost.wordpress.com/2024/12/01/winter-tales-2024-the-bright-room-of-cranmore/).
