Another tale of reincarnation, by Victor Rousseau.

In [**"The Woman of Atlantis,"**](/victor-rousseau/woman-of-atlantis) Dr. Immanuel's latest patient is a successful writer named Field, whose new novel is a tragic love story, set in Atlantis. Field falls in love with Lota, the heroine of his novel--and out of love with his fiance, Cynthia. 
Can Dr. Immanuel resolve the past-life issues that are tearing Field's life and relationships apart?

The next two Dr. Immanuel stories to appear in the *Evening Republican* were "A Fisher for Souls." It's not a terrible story, but it expresses some opinions that are a bit too racist for my taste. So rather than transcribe it, I'll just link to it, for the curious who still wish to read it.

You can find that link, as well as all the Dr. Immanuel stories that I've transcribed or linked to so far, at the [project page](/pages/victor-rousseau/#dr-phileas-immanuel-tracer-of-egos).
