*Little Johnny faces a lean Christmas, with no toys, no cheer, hardly enough food. Then, from some unseen world, comes----*

The tinkle of a tiny bell, shaken vigorously by a scarlet-coated
Salvation Army Santa at the curb, echoed cheerily through the frosty
air.  I stepped into the doorway of a little shop whose lights,
peeping from behind panes festooned with greens and holly, shone out
into the shabby thoroughfare.

For my numbed and tired limbs called for a moment or two of rest.
Rest, beyond the reaches of the steadily falling snow which the wind
from the not-distant river whipped into swirls before tossing it into
drifts along the pavement. Rest, to recover a bit of energy to continue the gladsome task which had kept me on the move almost continuously since early morning.

<p class="caption">"And his features--somehow they appeared familiar." </p>

For it was Christmas Eve, and I had spent the day distributing gifts
and money among those of the great city's needy whom I knew
personally.

As I wiped the snow from eyes and dusted it from the fur about my
throat, the little bell again sent forth its merry clatter.

I looked at the counterfeit Santa who stamped energetically about
his kettle to keep up circulation in his body. But no hint of his
personal discomfort could be noted in his twinkling eyes, or his mouth
twisted into a grin behind his ill-fitting whiskers.

And, as one or another of the bundle laden crowd that trudged past
him tossed a coin into the snow covered bottom of his kettle, there seemed to be music in the tone of his never failing,"Thank you! Merry Christmas!"

Anxious to do my bit toward keeping that particular pot boiling with a
liberal contribution which would go toward providing a bumper
Christmas dinner for the city's derelicts on the morrow, I opened my
purse and reached deep with eager fingers. But I gasped a bit when
they drew forth but two coins: a silver quarter and a nickel.

"Surely there must be some mistake," I thought. "There must be a bill
or two hidden in some corner." But, though I searched each pocket
carefully, not even a stray penny rewarded me. I had been even more
liberal in my Christmas giving than I had supposed. All that remained
was thirty cents.

And even that shabby sum would have to be divided. For between the
little shop on the outskirts of a tenement-lined stretch of Murray
Hill, in whose doorway I had sought temporary shelter, and my home
in the middle reaches of Riverside drive, there lay several miles of
slippery streets. I could not walk the distance. Unfatigued I would
have hesitated to attempt the hike in the face of the storm which made
all making a real eltone to already make my way on foot. The nickel
must go for a subway ride which would carry me over a portion of my
journey.

I dropped the smaller coin back into my purse. But, as I held the
other, ready to toss it into Santa's yawning kettle, a new thought
came to plague me—one which drove all other ideas temporarily from my
mind.

I had not yet visited the Kelly tenement at the other end of Murray
Hill.  The little three-room flat in which lived the widow, Bridget
Kelly, who eked out just sufficient by "day work" to maintain a home
and feed and clothe herself and her five-year-old son, Johnny. What
would Johnny think if I missed him?

Tears of vexation came to my eyes as I thought of them.  For I was
fond of Bridget, always hard working and uncomplaining. And of all
my young friends, I loved Johnny most. For he was a manly fellow, ever
planning and looking forward to the day when he would be old enough to
"go to work and help Mother."

I would have given material help long ago—to both of them—but the
proud Bridget would not permit. Kind words she welcomed. Charity she
refused. She would continue to work and care for Johnny until he had
been to school.  And then—

But how could I have forgotten them? They had been foremost in my mind
when I left home that morning. For three years I had done what I could
to make Johnny's Christmas brighter—to prove that Santa Claus remembered the children of the tenements as well as those of the avenues. My lapse of memory hurt, Even though I had been climbing stairways since early morning, though time after time I had replenished my stock of toys and candy, though I had spent hours planning the distribution of gifts with wan and work-worn mothers, I should not have forgotten Johnny.

Then, as many times, since I first had become acquainted with
Mrs. Kelly and her little son, I wished that, by some freak of chance,
they could be placed in possession of a secret hoard of money I was
certain that old house contained. Money which had been hidden there
by a former owner. That cache probably would be sufficient to place
the plucky widow and her boy beyond want for a long time.

But I put aside my wish in order that I might consider the more
material need of the present.  It was not too late, even then, to make
good for my lapse. I glanced at my watch. Only nine o'clock. Bracing
myself for the long walk to the nearest subway station, I plunged out
into the storm. My quarter plumped into the snow at the bottom of
Santa's kettle as I reached the curb.  And his cheery, "Thank you,
lady! Merry Christmas!" followed me as I dodged across the roadway
through lumbering, swerving vehicles.

It was not until I had edged my way into a seat in the car of a
northbound train that I had opportunity to think of anything but the
storm which I had breasted, of how to keep from slipping, and keep the
snow from my eyes so that I could note the streets I traversed. But,
when I recovered my wits, I at once remembered Johnny and the
necessity of preventing bitter disappointment coming to him on the
morrow. And the thought seemed to give me new strength and courage. I
was eager to carry on until I had fulfilled the task to which I had
set myself.

Then, probably because of old associations connected with the tenement
in which the Kellys lived, I recalled the first Christmas Eve I could
remember. For it had been spent in the self same structure.  But
things were so different then, when I was four years old. In those
days Murray Hill still retained its pristine glory as Manhattan's
mid-town social centre. Only a scattering of shops had encroached.
And the tall, grim loft buildings had not yet appeared to shut out the
air and sunshine. Refinement, culture and quiet had not yet yielded
to the demands of manufacture and trade, the kind which always brought
squalor, dingy tenements, and rumbling trucks in its wake.

In that period the tenement in which Johnny and his mother lived was a
proud, old house of ornate design, five stories in height and with a
scrolled balcony of iron, stretching across its parlor floor.

And there had lived the Huntingtons, the universally beloved Archer
Huntington, and his beautitul wife, Dolly.  Archer had been a great
shipping master and a financial power in The Street; a man of
enormous wealth for those days. But, with all their material prosperity, the Huntington home had lacked the one thing to make it complete—a child.

One had come—a little boy. But he had been taken away before a year
had passed. There had been no other. However, though childless,
Archer and his wife had loved children with a passion which surpassed
all other interests for them. Their home always was the playground
for the little ones of their relatives and friends.  And Dolly,
despite the frail, little body which made her almost an invalid,
went about daily into the homes along the waterfront looking after the
needs of the children of the poorer families.

Archer backed her splendidly in these efforts.  But his big days came
with Christmas, when he could gather children about him to his
heart's content.  The day before Christmas, in an old hall far down in
the Bowery, he held open house for the youngsters of the city's poor,
where there was a gigantic tree ablaze with colored candles and long
tables, heaped high with goodies; and ice cream and candy to follow.

However, it was after the feast when old Archer was truly in his
element.  For then, clad in scarlet cap and fur-trimmed coat, with
shining boots that reached almost to his hips, he played Santa Claus,
heaping toys into the arms of each eager child as it filed past him.
And he looked the part. For he was short and stout, with a waistline
that stretched the belt about his gaily colored doublet.  And framing
his laughing eyes and ruddy cheeks was a mass of snowy whiskers that
made artificial disguise unnecessary.

In the evening, in his great stone mansion just off the avenue,
there would be another celebration—a splendid Christmas Eve party,
to which would flock the children of his friends. And again he would
play Saint Nick. and help happy Dolly distribute the creams and favors
and pass about the presents, taken from a glittering tree, with each
little one's name written upon the wrapper.  And it was at Santa Claus
Huntington's that I attended my first Christmas party. I was an
excited, wide-eyed little miss whose great hope was fulfilled when
Santa Claus Huntington himself gave me a big doll with flaxen hair
that could say "mamma."

However, that was my only party there. For, the following summer
Archer and his wife steamed away in a yacht for ports in the South
Seas, where it was hoped the warmer breezes would restore the roses to
Dolly's cheeks. But the yacht never reached its destination.  And
though my father, Archer's life-long friend and business associate,
conducted a world-wide search for it, neither the boat nor its
passengers were ever heard of again.

My father, as well as others of Archer's intimates, knew that,
somewhere in the house, he always kept a considerable store of ready
cash for emergencies—such as his own and Dolly's charities, or to aid
less prosperous friends in need of loans, for which no papers would be
signed or interest exacted. This hiding place, known only to him, was
hunted for repeatedly, but never uncovered.

Then followed long years in which the old house remained closed and
its windows boarded up. The neighborhood changed. Ugly business
structures elbowed their way in. Workmen descended upon the old
houses that remained, altering them inside and out, dividing the
great rooms into smaller ones—making them over into beehives for
humans. And into these tenements moved those who were compelled to
count their pennies—the overflow of the poor from Five Points, Hell's
Kitchen and Mulberry Bend.

Finally the Huntington estate was disposed of. My father purchased
the old house, hoping, for sentimental reasons, to rent it as it
stood, thereby preserving its outward appearance at least. But he had
failed in that objective.  No one wanted a whole house in that teeming
tenement district. So, though my father continued his ownership, he
permitted it, like its neighbors, to be rebuilt into small flats.

In those years my mother had died, leaving only me to care for
Dad. But, though his hair became thin and frosted, though the old fire
in his eyes was reduced to smouldering embers and he laughed only
when he and I were alone in the great library at night, the blow of
losing the woman who had stood by him through his early struggles did
not sour him.

In Archer's time, Dad always had assisted him in carrying out his
plans to make children happy, though he always kept in the
background.  After his partner disappeared, he continued to carry on
the labor of love, but in his own way. His nature would not permit him
to play Santa Claus. But on each day before Christmas, with his
pockets bulging with bills and a car loaded with toys, he visited the
homes of every employee of his bank and personally distributed his
gifts to the children and left money for their entertainment at a
theatre or elsewhere on the holiday.

Today, as usual, he must have been out among his little friends. I
hoped he wasn't very tired. For Dad was getting older. The spring in
his step—

The raucous shout of the train guard roused me from my reverie.  Although I did not catch his jumbled words, I knew instinctively I had
reached the station nearest my home. And, joining the jostling
crowd, I left the train, climbed the sodden steps and again headed out
into the storm which had increased in intensity.

But, still buoyed up with thoughts of what I had planned to do for
Johnny that night, I made speed over the few blocks which brought me
to where I knew Dad would be waiting—probably anxious because I was
returning later than customary.

As Judson swung wide the front doors, I tossed my dripping coat and
hat upon a chair and burst into the library with a cry of, "Dad, Dad,
where are you?"

But I was sorry I had been so precipitate. For he had been dozing,
in his big chair before the fire-place, one hand shading his eyes. And
I noted those eyes were tired—very, as with "Tony, you little
gadabout, where have you been until this unearthly hour?" he came to
his feet, arms outstretched, a great smile driving the wrinkles of
fatigue from his features.

"Sit down, Dad,"—after the first big hug and kiss. I forced him gently
back into his chair, and drew another beside him.  "You're all worn
out tonight.  Have you been overdoing things?"

"Nothing of the kind, Tony girl," and he slipped a hand over, and
held, one of mine. "Besides," and he chuckled, "it was in a good cause—and 
only once a year, you know. But tell me—where have you been?"

"Oh, doing the same as on every December twenty-fourth, only a little
more so.  There seemed to be so much to talk about everywhere
and—well, I stayed longer in places than I expected."

"Never mind, if you didn't get wet feet. Let me see. No. Fine! Now
I'll order some coffee and we'll have a nice, comfy chat until the
chimes—"

"You're a dear, Dad. But—I can't do more than drink one cup. Then I
must be off again—"

"You must— What do you mean?"

"Dad, I'm really ashamed of myself.  But you remember the Kellys—"

"You mean Bridget and little Johnny?"  He nodded.

"Yes. And would you believe it, I all but forgot them?"

Then, as his eyes opened wide in thoughtful interest, I told him how I
had recollected my lapse, my subway trip on my last nickel and what
the thought of the Kelly tenement had recalled—my first Christmas Eve
party, and Archer Huntington playing Santa Claus.

"That's strange, Tony," he interrupted, his brows coming down into a
pucker.  "It seems as if I've been thinking of good, old Archer most
of the day myself.  Sometimes I felt almost as if he were near me,
particularly when I was with the children. Maybe, Tony girl, he was
closer than I knew. We can't tell."

"Do you know, Dad, recalling Archer made me think of the money still
hidden away somewhere in that old building.  And I also thought—if
only the Kellys had found it—what a glorious Christmas present it
would be for them."

"It certainly would." He smiled "But that money is gone—at least until
the wreckers tear down the house. Now let us let us get right down to the practical side of your predicament. I suppose you want some money to make good to little Johnny?"

"Yes, Dad, heaps of it. I'm going to give him the best Christmas he
ever had. I'm going to try to atone for my forgetfulness, Dad—make
good to the memory of Santa Claus Huntington for that first splendid
Christmas he gave me."

Dad's hand went into his pocket and came out clutching a roll of bills
which he thrust into my fingers.

"Make it the kind of a Christmas for Johnny you've been thinking
about—then add a little more for Archer."

"Oh, Dad, I'll do it. And I'll thank you more tomorrow, when I have
time.  A big kiss and I'm off."

"But, Tony, it's a bad night. I think I'd better go with you and—"

"No, Dad. I'll dress warmly and—"

"But—"

"No 'buts,' Dad." I sat upon the arm of his chair, drew his head about
until I looked full into his eyes, and brushed a strand of gray from
his forehead. "I know you're game to go, if I say the word.  But
you're tired—far more than you realize.

"Besides, this is my job. I overlooked a real duty. Now I must make
good.  It won't take as long as you think. If you want to wait and
doze and smoke here, we'll say, 'Merry Christmas' together, maybe
with the chimes. I'll use the big car this time. No more being caught with but a nickel carfare. If  you'd rather go to bed, I won't mind.  For I want you fresh and rosy tomorrow, when you must be Santa Claus for me."

"All right, Tony. I'll telephone to Jim and Reddy to bring the machine around while you're getting ready.  You'll need both of them with you to help carry the bundles and—well, if you should have a blowout on such a night—"

"Nothing like that is going to happen," I cried, giving him a final
hug and kiss and dashing away. But he followed me into the hallway,
shouting, "Good luck," over and over again as I hurried to my room, my
precious roll of bills clutched tightly in my hand.

While changing to a heavier dress and directing Minnie to strap on a
pair of arctics as a further protection against the drifts through
which I must wade while making my purchases, I thought of Mrs. Kelly
and the probably meager covering she possessed to shield her against
weather such as the night had brought.

In a closet was a heavy coat, with cuffs and collar of fur, which I
had bought for the housekeeper.  She and Mrs. Kelly were about of a
size.  It would meet the emergency splendidly. The widow would have the coat and I would give the housekeeper money to get another.

It hung over one arm and my purse with the money for the Kellys'
Christmas gifts was over the other when I again headed out into the
snow.

"Where to, Miss?" queried Jim, while Reddy helped me into the car and
tucked a big, warm robe about me.

"Hurry over to upper Broadway—some place where the shops are certain
to be open. I must get a lot of toys and candy and—things.  Then we're
going over to Murray Hill. You know, where the Kelly family lives."

Another moment and we had turned the corner and were lurching ahead,
horn rasping, our lights penetrating but little through the blanket of
whirling flakes in front. But we reached the avenue safely. And the
shops still were open, caring for last minute purchasers like myself.

With Reddy at my elbow, I plunged in and out of several, making my
purchases quickly, while bill after bill disappeared from the roll of
yellow and green backs. I bought toys and candy and more toys and
fruit—until Reddy informed me the car was pretty well filled. But I
only laughed. There must be room for a few more parcels. I had
promised myself that Johnny's Christmas was to be a bumper one. And
I was determined he should fare as splendidly as any boy in all New
York.

My final errand was to a neighborhood department store, where the
weary clerks already were preparing to close.  "I am going to leave
all choice to you," I said to a man behind the nearest counter. "I
want a number of things for a five-year-old boy, of slight build and
about so high-—two pairs of shoes, rubbers, two suits, an overcoat, a
fur cap, gloves and a box of wool stockings.  Don't show them to me,
but give me the best. And please hurry."

I don't believe I ever was happier in my life; not even at my first
Christmas party, as the car zig-zagged its way across town and down
toward Murray Hill.  Even Archer Huntington, if he were looking down
upon me, must have smiled at my effort to follow in his
footsteps. For, somehow, I seemed to feel that he was responsible for
the joy of giving, which I always had known at Christmas time.  When
we finally drew up before the ramshackle old building which housed
the Kellys, with only a lighted window here and there to relieve its
dull front, I caught the echo of chimes from some nearby church,
hushed and muffled by the storm till they sounded like some wayside
angelus bells.

Christmas had come. It was the midnight hour when Santa Claus must
start upon his all important journey.

I laughed happily as I stepped from the car, while Reddy closed the
door behind me. "Merry Christmas, boys.  Wait here until I come
back. I want to make certain Johnny is asleep. Then we can take the
gifts to his mother." I carried only the coat, which was to be my
personal gift to Bridget Kelly.

As I entered the hallway I encountered the janitress, reaching aloft
to turn the sputtering gas flame to a mere speck, the customary
illumination for those of the tenements who returned home after
midnight.

She pushed her spectacles closer to her eyes, then, "And can it be
yourself, Miss Gregory? And on such a night and so late? I'll be
certain 'tis the Kellys you came to see.  But she isn't home."

"Why, she can't be working so late."

"No. But one of the neighbors down the block's been taken sick.
She's gone to help. I'm lookin' in on Johnny while she's away. But
he's asleep now. I just came from up there.  The door's open if you'd
care to go up."

"Thanks. I've some Christmas things for them. I'll just make certain
Johnny's still asleep. Then I'll have them put in Mrs. Kelly's
kitchen. You can tell her they're there when she returns."

"Bless you, Miss, they'll sure be appreciated this year.  Bridget
hasn't been able to work much lately and the doctors cost a lot o'
money. I fear she couldn't get much for the laddie for Christmas and—"

"Yes?"

"Well, don't says as I said so, but I guess. they been a eatin' pretty
poorly for the last week."

I drew another bill, a twenty, from my almost depleted roll, then went
to the door and told Reddy to go to the store around the corner and
get a big turkey and all the trimmings.

When I reached the fourth floor, where the Kellys lived, in the rear,
I listened. No sound came from within. And but the tiniest chink of light showed beneath the second door, which I knew opened directly upon the kitchen and living room. Johnny slept there. For it kept him near the big stove, which supplied all the heat for the diminutive flat.

On tip-toe I moved to the other door, the one to the narrow inner
hallway. I turned the knob gently, entered without sound and closed it
behind me.  The place was fearsomely still.  But, as I listened. I
caught the faint, regular breathing of a child. Johnny was asleep.  I
moved to the doorway of the kitchen.  A lamp burned upon a table,
placed so that its rays fell upon the boy's bed, probably to give him
courage to remain alone while his mother was absent upon her errand of
mercy.

Then my eyes wandered about and across the shadows, to the stove and
the old mantel behind it. A lump came into my throat as I noted the
little stocking hanging there.  Johnny's stocking, waiting to be
filled by Santa Claus.

Poor little laddie. And I had almost forgotten him. No Santa would
come to the Kelly flat. But there would be gifts aplenty—more than
Johnny possibly could have dreamed of possessing.

No need to wait for the return of Mrs.  Kelly. Reddy and I would bring
the gifts and leave them. Johnny was too sound asleep to awaken. And
we would move quietly.

I was about to turn back into the hallway when suddenly, with a gasp
of fright, Johnny sat straight up in bed and stared before him, toward
the stove, with wide eyes, his mouth agape.

I turned and looked, where he was gazing. And my whole body went numb
and I leaned against the casement, half dazed, at what I saw.

For, standing atop the stove—stood Santa Claus—as I had seen him
pictured —thousands of times—smiling, eyes shining, a wide belt
holding his fur trimmed jacket close to his fat, round stomach and
high boots coming far up over his short legs. Only his pack of toys
was missing.

But, as I gazed, as speechless as Johnny, the feeling of fear slipped
from me. Then I noted that the figure appeared shadowy, in some
indescribable way—unlike the body of a person one could reach out and
touch.

And his features—somehow they appeared familiar. There was something
about the look in his eyes, his jolly grin, his long, flowing white
whiskers, which I seemed to remember.

"Merry Christmas, Johnny, Merry Christmas!" The voice seemed to
crackle with good nature and merriment.

"Merry Chr—" Johnny's greeting died away in an awed whisper.

{% image "./images/come-johnny.png", "Santa stands on a table, looking down on a young boy in bed." %}
<p class="caption">"Come, come Johnny. You're not afraid of Santa Claus, are you?" </p>

"Come,come, Johnny.  You're not afraid of Santa Claus, are you?"

"N-no, sir." The lad's tone was more confident.

"That's better. I see you expected me, and hung up your stocking
here." His rolling chuckle brought a grin to the boy's face.

"Now, Johnny, tell me.  Have you been a good boy all year?"

"I—I guess so. Mother says so."

"That's fine."  Then he winked.  "Mothers always know, don't they?"

Johnny nodded solemnly.

"And, since you've been a good boy, I suppose you expect a lot of presents?"

"No, sir. Not this year."

A momentary shadow flitted across the old fellow's face. He hopped
from the stove, stepped to Johnny's bed, and leaned over familiarly,
resting his elbows upon the footboard.

"Do you mean you don't expect presents because I haven't my pack
with me?"

"No, sir. Not 'zactly. But—"

"Of course not. You wouldn't expect Santa Claus to show little boys
what he's going to leave for them, now would you?"

Johnny hesitated, as if lost for words.  Then, "I—I guess I don't
know—quite—Mister.  But Mother's been sick, a whole lot. And she said
when there's sickness you don't leave much until they're well again—"

"Wait a minute, Johnny" The old fellow raised a hand that trembled,
and he held it before his eyes.  "Listen, my boy. Mothers are right—almost always. But—well, never mind.  Now here's a secret, just between you and me. I'm going to surprise Mother this time. I'm going to make it a real Merry Christmas for you both."

"Oh, good!"

"Yes, Johnny. There's going to be toys for you, heaps of them—and new
clothes and candy and a big dinner with turkey and red cranberry jelly
and—"

"Gee!"

"And listen—stoop closer.  There's going to be a new coat for Mother—a
long, warm one, with a big fur collar and—a big surprise for you both."

The lad was astonished into complete silence.

"But, Johnny, Santa Claus can't leave things while little, boys are
awake. You must close your eyes, tight, and go to sleep. Then all the
fine presents will be left—"

"And we can have them in the morning?"

"You surely can. And if you're a good boy next year, there'll be more
presents. Now good night and a Merry Christmas!"

With a flash like that of a darting shadow, the little man hopped to
the stove, then to the mantel—and disappeared into nothingness.

But, as he disappeared, there came a crash—one which startled me and
brought a cry from Johnny, crouching in his bed, his eyes wide,
staring after his departed visitor. Then he dropped back upon his
pillow, his tiny mouth held in a smile as his lids closed and he again
drifted into slumberland.

However, the crash meant more to me than it had to the boy, too
excited because of his talk with Santa Claus to pay more than
passing heed to other things. Waiting only until I noted his regular
breathing, I tip-toed to the stove.  Beside it lay a little pile of
glass, caused by a vase from the mantel having fallen and broken.

But it was the appearance of the mantel which caught and held me. A
piece of the top, fully a foot in length, had dropped and was
hanging. I stepped closer.  The piece was held by a hinge, cunningly
set into the wall. And the exposed top of the upright showed an
opening. I plunged my hand into it—drew out a small tin box. This I
carried nearer the light. It was unlocked.  I raised the
lid—exposing a heap of coins, mostly gold. In a flash the truth came
to me.  The hidden cache of treasure finally was exposed. Instantly I
determined it should be added to the Christmas gifts of Bridget and
Johnny.

And, as I turned away to go below and tell Reddy and Jim to bring the
presents I had brought, I knew, beyond all question, that the Santa
Claus I had seen was the phantom of Archer Huntington—that it was
Archer Huntington's Christmas ghost who had touched the spring that
had uncovered the long hidden treasure—to gladden the heart of
little Johnny Kelly!
