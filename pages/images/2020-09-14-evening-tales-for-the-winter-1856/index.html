<p><em>Evening Tales for the Winter</em> is an 1856 anthology of supernatural and gothic tales, compiled by Henry St. Clair. The first two volumes were originally published as <em>Tales of Terror, or the Mysteries of Magic</em> (1833). Its subtitle is &quot;Wonderful &amp; Supernatural Stories Translated from the Chinese, Turkish and German.&quot; Neither the translators nor the original authors/sources are credited.</p>

<p>Not all the pieces are actually translations, and none of them are from the Chinese or Turkish. Several are from German, two of them translated by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_De_Quincey">Thomas de Quincey</a>.</p>
<p>And some are historically interesting, too. Early on in this project, I found <a href="https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2020/09/16/the-puzzle-of-judar/">the first English translation of a story from <em>The Thousand and One Nights</em></a>. Later, I discovered <a href="https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/2021/01/17/notes-on-the-astrologer-of-the-nineteenth-century/">the first English translation of (part of) an infamous German gothic novel</a>. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>The anthology is in three volumes, and I set up a separate Table of Contents plus attributions for each volume. Each Table of Contents links to a post about the individual stories, where I discuss my research and sometimes include a PDF transcription of the story.</p>

<li><a href="https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/evening-tales-for-the-winter-volume-two/">Table of Contents and Attributions, Volume 2</a></li>
<li><a href="https://darktalessleuth.wordpress.com/evening-tales-for-the-winter-volume-three/">Table of Contents and Attributions, Volume 3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can find a (rather dirty) scan of <em>Evening Tales for the Winter</em> <a href="https://archive.org/details/eveningtalesfor00unkngoog">at the Internet Archive</a>. The original of that scanned volume came from the library of <a href="https://spartacus-educational.com/DICjewett.htm">Sarah Orne Jewett</a>, who like her contemporary Mary Wilkins Freeman wrote New England regional fiction, often with traces of the weird or supernatural.</p>
