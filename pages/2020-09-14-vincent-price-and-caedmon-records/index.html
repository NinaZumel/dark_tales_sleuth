<p>Caedmon Records, founded in 1952, was the first company to sell spoken word recordings to the public; the predecessors of the audiobook, you might say. In the 1970s, Vincent Price released several recordings for Caedmon, readings of ghost tales and fantasies.</p>

<p>You can find several of these recordings on YouTube. Price's smooth and expressive voice is always a pleasure to listen to, and the stories are engaging, more like ghostly folktales or urban legends than horror stories, but that suits me just fine.</p>
<p>I was surprised, however, that the first two LPs that I listened to give no credits for the readings. Nor could I find any information on literary sources anywhere online. So I decided to do a little digging on my own.</p>
<p>I haven't read most of the books or texts that I mention in these posts, so I can't one hundred percent guarantee my attributions. However, Jenny Ashford on the Facebook group <em>Alone with the Horrors: Horror Fiction</em> also did some digging (thank you, Jenny!), and her research seems consistent with mine. So, for now, here are my best educated guesses on the literary sources for <em>A Graveyard of Ghost Tales</em> and <em>Tales of Witches, Ghosts, and Goblins</em>.</p>
